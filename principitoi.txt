when i was six years old i saw in a book about the virgin forest that was titled lived stories a magnificent sheet represented a boa snake that swallowed a beast in the book it was stated the boa snake swallows its whole prey without chewing it then it can no longer move and sleep during the six months that its digestion lasts i reflected a lot at that moment about the adventures of the jungle and at the same time i managed to trace with a colored pencil my first drawing my number drawing was in this way i showed my work of art to people older people and i asked them if my drawing scared them because it would scare a hat they answered me my drawing did not represent a hat it represented a boa snake that digests an elephant then draw the inside of the boa snake so that older people could understand you are always people need explanations my drawing number was like that older people advised me to abandon the drawing of boas snakes whether open or closed and put more interest in geography history calculation and grammar in this way at the age of six i quit a magnificent career as a painter had been disappointed by the failure of my drawings number and number older people can never understand something by themselves and it is very boring for children to have to give them explanations again and again i had to choose another trade and learned piloting airplanes i have flown a little around the world and geography has indeed served me a lot at first glance i could perfectly distinguish china from arizona this is very useful especially if you lose one during the night throughout my life had crowd of contacts with a multitude of serious people i lived a lot with older people and i have known them very closely but this has not improved my opinion about them too much when i have met someone who seemed a little lucid to me i have subjected him to the experience of my drawing the number that i have always kept i wanted to know if i was truly an understanding being and they invariably answered me it is a hat i refrained from talking to them about the boa snake of the virgin forest and the stars putting myself at their height i spoke to them about the bridge of politics and golf of ties and my interlocutor was very happy to meet such a reasonable man only nobody lived with whom i could truly speak until six years ago i had a breakdown in the sahara desert something had broken in the engine as i did not carry with me or mechanical nor any passenger i prepared to carry out a difficult repair myself it was for me a matter of life or death because i barely had drinking water for eight days the first night i fell asleep on the sand about a thousand miles away from the nearest inhabited place more isolated than a shipwrecked man on a raft in the middle of the ocean imagine my surprise when at dawn a strange little voice woke me up that said please paint me a lamb huh paint me a lamb i jumped to my feet as if injured by lightning i rubbed my eyes i looked around me i saw an extraordinary little boy who looked at me seriously there they have the best portrait that later i managed to make of him although my drawing is certainly less charming than the model but it is not my fault the older people discouraged me from my career as a painter at the age of six and not i had learned to draw something other than closed boas and open boas look at that apparition with round eyes of admiration we must not forget that i was about a thousand miles away from the nearest inhabited place and now the boy did not seem to me or lost nor died of fatigue hunger thirst or fear he did not look at all like a child lost in the desert a thousand miles away from the nearest inhabited place when i finally managed to speak a word i told him absolute the appearance of a child lost in the desert a thousand miles away from the nearest inhabited place when i finally managed to articulate a word i said absolute the appearance of a child lost in the desert a thousand miles away from the nearest inhabited place when i finally managed to articulate a word i said but what are you doing around here and he answered then softly as something very important please paint me a lamb when the mystery is too impressive it is impossible to disobey as absurd that it seemed to me a thousand miles away from every inhabited place and in danger of death remove from my pocket a sheet of paper and a fountain pen i remembered that i had specially studied geography history calculus and grammar and i told the little boy already a little grumpy that he did not know how to draw it does not matter he replied paint me a lamb as i had never drawn a lamb the one of the only two drawings that i was able to make is that of the closed boa snake and i was stunned when i heard the little man say no i do not want an elephant in a snake the snake is very dangerous and the elephant occupies a lot of space in me earth is all very small i need a lamb paint me a lamb draw a lamb i look at him carefully and said no this is already very sick make another one i redrew my friend smiled sweetly with indulgence you see this is not a lamb it is a ram it has horns i remade my drawing was rejected like the previous ones this is too old i want a lamb that lives a long time already lacking patience and eager to start disassembling the motor quickly scribble this drawing i showed it and added this is the box the lamb you want is inside to my great surprise the face of my young judge lit up that is how i wanted it do you think a lot of grass is necessary for this lamb because in my land everything is so small he leaned towards the drawing and exclaimed well not so small he is asleep and that is how i met the little prince it took me a long time to understand where the little prince came from who asked me many questions he never seemed to hear mine they were words pronounced at random that little by little revealed everything to me so when he distinguished my plane for the first time i will not draw my plane because it is about a drawing too complicated for me i wonder what that thing is that is not a thing that flies is a plane my plane i was proud to tell him that he was flying then he shouted like you have fallen from the sky if i told him modestly oh how curious and the little prince threw a funny laugh that irritated me a lot i like that my misfortunes are taken seriously and added then you also come from the sky of which planet are you i saw a light in the mystery of his presence and i asked him abruptly you come from another planet but not he answered me slowly moving the head looking carefully at my plane it is true that on top of that you cannot come from very far and he sank into a reverie for a long time then taking out of his pocket my lamb plunged into the contemplation of his treasure imagine how this semi-confidentiality intrigue me on the others planets i do my best to know something else where you come from little boy where is your house where do you want to take my lamb well i will also give you a rope and a stake to tie it during the day this proposition seemed to shock the little prince to tie it what a strange idea if you do not tie it he will go who knows where and he will get lost my friend let out a new laugh and where you want him to go i do not know anywhere right i walk ahead then the little prince pointed out with gravity it does not matter my land is so small and i add maybe with a little melancholy right way forward you cannot go very far in this way i knew a second very important thing his home planet was barely bigger than a house this could not surprise me much i knew very well that apart from the great planets like the earth jupiter mars venus to which they have been named there are hundreds of other names have been given there are hundreds of other names have been given there are hundreds of other they are so small sometimes that it is difficult to distinguish them even with the help of the telescope when an astronomer discovers one of these planets he gives him by name a number he calls it for example the asteroid i have strong reasons to believe that the planet from which the little prince came was the asteroid b this asteroid has been seen only once with the telescope in by a turkish astronomer this astronomer made a great demonstration of his discovery at an international astronomy congress but nobody believed him because of his way of dressing older people are happily like this for the reputation of asteroid b a turkish dictator imposed on his people under pain of death the european dress then the astronomer returned to account for his discovery in and how he looked in a very elegant suit everyone accepted his demonstration if i have told you from all these details about the asteroid by i have even entrusted their number is for consideration older people older people like figures when they are told about a new friend they never ask about the essentials of it it never occurs to them to ask what tone it has his voice which games he prefers he likes to collect butterflies but instead they ask how old he is how many siblings how much weighs how much does his father earn just with these details they think they know him if we tell the elderly i have seen a beautiful pink brick house with geraniums in the windows and pigeons on the roof will never imagine what that house is like it is necessary to tell them i have seen a house that is worth a hundred thousand pesos so they exclaim excitedly oh how beautiful it is in such a way if we tell them the proof that the little prince has existed this in which he was a charming little boy who laughed and wanted a lamb to want a lamb is proof that it exists older people will shrug their shoulders and tell us that we are children but if we tell them the planet where the little prince came from was the asteroid b they would be convinced and not they will worry about asking more questions they are like that there is no reason to hold a grudge against them children should be very lenient with older people but we who know how to understand life quietly make fun of the numbers i would have liked more to start this story in the way of fairy tales i would have liked to say was once a little prince who inhabited a planet barely bigger than him and who needed a friend for those who understand life this would have seemed more real because i do not like my book to be taken to i feel lightly so sad to tell these memories six years ago that my friend left with his lamb and if i try to describe it here it is only in order not to forget it is very sad to forget a friend not everyone has had a friend and i can become like older people who are only interested in figures to avoid this i have bought a box of colored pencils it is very hard at my age to learn to draw when in all my life there has been no attempt other than that of an open boa and a closed boa at the age of six certainly that i will try to make portraits as similar as possible but i am not very sure of achieving it one will come out well and the other has no similarity in the proportions i am also a little wrong here the little prince is too much big and there is too small i also doubt about the color of his suit i hesitate about this and that and sometimes it turns out well and sometimes it turns out badly it is possible that i am wrong about certain very important details but i will have to forgive me since my friend never gave me many explanations He believed me to be similar to himself and i unfortunately do not see a lamb through a box it is possible that i am a bit like older people i have had to grow old and every day i learned something new about the planet on the departure and on the trip this came softly at random from the reflections of this older people i must have grown old and every day i learned something new about the planet on the departure and on the trip this came softly at random from the reflections of this older people i must have grown old and every day i learned something new about the planet on the departure and on the trip this came softly at random from the reflections of this the way i found out on the third day of the drama of the baobabs it was also thanks to the lamb and as worried about a deep doubt when the little prince asked me is it true that lambs eat the bushes it was important for the lambs to eat the bushes but the little prince added then they also eat the baobabs i made the little prince understand that the baobabs are not bushes but trees as big as churches and that even if he took with him a whole herd of elephants the herd i would not be able to end up with a single baobab this idea of the herd of elephants made the little prince laugh he would have to put the elephants on top of each other and then judiciously add the baobabs before they grow up they are very small it is true but why do you want your lambs to eat the baobabs answered me well let is go as if i were talking about an evidence it took me a great effort of intelligence to understand for myself this problem in effect on the planet of the little prince there were good herbs and bad herbs therefore good seeds came out good herbs and seeds weeds bad herbs but the seeds are invisible they sleep in the secret of the earth until one day one of them has the fantasy of waking up then it lengthens extending towards the sun first timidly a charming harmless twig if it comes you can let a sprig of radish or rosebush grow as you like but if it is a weed it is necessary to pull it out immediately as soon as one has recognized it on the planet of the little prince there were terrible seeds like seeds the soil of the planet is infested with baobab if a baobab is not uprooted in time there is no way to get rid of it later it covers the entire planet and pierces it with its roots and if the planet is too small and the baobabs are numerous it they blow up is a matter of discipline the little prince told me later when in the morning you finish getting ready you have to do the cleaning of the planet carefully you have to dedicate yourself regularly to uprooting the baobabs when they are distinguished from the rose bushes to which they are very similar when they are little it is a very tedious but very easy job and one day he advised me to dedicate myself to making a beautiful drawing that would make the children of the earth understand these ideas if they ever travel he would tell me this could be very useful sometimes there is no problem in leaving for more late the work that has to be done but in the case of baobabs the delay is always a catastrophe i have known a planet inhabited by a sloth that neglected three bushes following the instructions of the little prince i draw this planet although i do not like the role of moralist the danger of baobabs are so unknown and the dangers that can run who get lost in an asteroid are so great that i do not hesitate to make an exception and shout children attention to baobabs and only in order to warn my friends of these dangers to what they have been exhibited for a long time without knowing it that is why i worked and i put so much effort in making this drawing the lesson that i could give was worth it with it is very possible that someone asks me why there are no other drawings in this book as great as the baobab drawing the answer is i have tried to do them very simply but i have not succeeded when i drew the baobabs i was animated by a feeling of urgency i saw a little prince how i have slowly understood your melancholic life for a long time your only distraction was the softness of the sunsets this new detail i knew it on the fourth day when you told me i like sunsets a lot let's see a sunset we'll have to wait for the sun to set you seemed very surprised first and then you laughed at yourself and me when you told me i like sunsets a lot let's see a sunset we'll have to wait for the sun to set you seemed very surprised first and then you laughed at yourself and me when you told me i like sunsets a lot let's see a sunset we'll have to wait for the sun to set you seemed very surprised first and then you laughed at yourself and me you always said i believe that i am in my land in fact as everyone knows when it is noon in the united states in france the sun is setting it would be enough to be able to move to France in a minute to attend the sunset but unfortunately france is too much far away on your little planet you just had to drag the chair a few steps to witness the twilight every time you wanted it one day i saw the sun go down fortythree times and a little later you added you know when one is truly sad likes to see the sunsets the day you saw her forty-three times you were very sad but the little prince did not respond it on the fifth day and also in relation to the lamb this other secret of the little prince's life was revealed to me i was asked abruptly and without preamble as a result of a problem long meditated in silence if a lamb eats the bushes it will also eat the flowers not a lamb eats everything it finds and also the flowers that have thorns if also the flowers that have thorns then what are the thorns for i confess that no i knew that i was very busy trying to unscrew a bolt that was too tight on the engine the breakdown was beginning to seem serious to me and the circumstance that my water supply was running out made me fear the worst what the thorns are for the little prince never allowed that a question asked by the one irritated by the resistance that the bolt opposed me will be left unanswered i don't believe you the flowers are weak they are naive they defend themselves as they can they think they are terrible with their thorns i did not answer anything at that moment i was saying to myself if this bolt resists me a little more i will make it jump with a hammer blow the little prince interrupted my thoughts you think that the flowers i don't believe anything i have answered you anything so that you shut up i have to deal with serious things i look at me dumbfounded about serious things i looked at me with my hammer in my hand fingers full of grease and bent over something that it seemed very ugly you speak like older people i am a bit ashamed but the relentless added you confuse everything you mix it up was truly irritated shake his head shaking his golden hair in the wind i know a planet where a very red man lives who has never smelled a flower or has looked at one star and who has never loved anyone in all his life has not done more than adds and all day he spends it repeating like you i am a serious man i am a serious man apparently this fills him with pride but that is not a man is a fungus a fungus the little prince was pale with anger millions of years ago that the flowers have thorns and also millions of years ago that the lambs in spite of the thorns eat the flowers is that it is not a serious thing to find out why the flowers waste time manufacturing thorns that are useless to them the war of the lambs is not important and the flowers is not more serious and important than the sums of a fat and red man and if i know of a flower unique in the world and that it does not exist anywhere but on my planet if i know that one good day a lamb can annihilate it without realizing it is that this is not important the little prince reddened and then continued if someone loves a flower of which there is only one example in millions and millions of stars just look at them to be happy you can say satisfied my flower is there somewhere but if the lamb eats it for him it is as if suddenly all the stars went out and this is not important he could not say more and burst into sobs the night had fallen i had dropped the tools and they no longer mattered anything the hammer the bolt thirst and death had in part but if the lamb eats it for him it is as if suddenly all the stars go out and this is not important he could not say more and burst into sobs the night had fallen i had dropped the tools and the hammer no longer mattered at all the bolt thirst and death had in part but if the lamb eats it for him it is as if suddenly all the stars went out and this is not important he could not say more and burst into sobs the night had fallen i had dropped the tools and the hammer no longer mattered at all the bolt thirst and death had in a star on a planet mine the earth a little prince to console i took him in my arms and rocked him telling him the flower that you want is not in danger i will draw you a muzzle for your lamb and an armor for the flower i did not know what to tell him how comfort him and make him trust me again i felt awkward the country of tears is so mysterious i learned very soon to know this flower better there had always been on the planet of the little prince very simple flowers adorned with a single row of petals that barely occupied the place no one bothered anymore they appeared among the grass one morning and in the afternoon they became extinct but that one had germinated one day from a seed that had come from who knows where and the little prince had carefully watched from the first day that twig so different from the ones he knew could be a new species of baobab but the bush soon ceased to grow and began to bloom the little prince observed the growth of a huge bud and was convinced that a miraculous appearance would come from there but the flower did not finish preparing its beauty under cover from its green wrapping it carefully chose its colors it dressed slowly and adjusted itself one by one its petals did not want to come out already worn out like the poppies it wanted to appear in all the splendor of its beauty that flower was very flirtatious its mysterious preparation lasted days and days until one morning precisely at sunrise the flower that had worked with such precision showed splendid said yawning ah forgive me i just woke up i am all disheveled the little prince could not contain his admiration that you are beautiful the truth sweetly replied the flower i have born at the same time as the sun the little prince guessed exactly that she was not very modest certainly but she was so moving it seems to me that it is time for breakfast he added the flower if you would kindly think a little about me and the very confused little prince having gone to look for a watering can he sprinkled it abundantly with fresh water and so she had tormented him with his vanity a bit gloomy one day for example talking about his four thorns he said to the little prince the tigers can come with their claws there are no tigers on my planet little prince and also tigers do not eat grass i am not an herb the flower replied sweetly forgive me i am not afraid of tigers but i am afraid of drafts you will not have a screen afraid of drafts it is not luck for a plant he thought little prince this flower is too complicated at night you will cover me with a lantern it is very cold in your land it is not very comfortable where i come from the flower was interrupted it had arrived there in the form of a seed such a naive lie he coughed two or three times to attract the sympathy of the little prince and the screen went to look for him but since you did not stop talking to me he insisted on his cough to give him at least remorse in this way the little prince despite the good will of his love he had come to doubt her he had taken unimportant words seriously and he felt unhappy i shouldn't pay attention to him i confessed one day the little prince never have to pay attention to the flowers just look at them and smell them my flower embalmed the planet but i did not know enjoy with that that tale of claw and tigers that annoyed me so much should have touched me and told me i still did not understand anything so i should have judged her for her actions and not for her words the flower perfumed and illuminated my life and i never had to flee from there i did not know how to guess the tenderness that her poor cunning hid the flowers are so contradictory but i was too young to know how to love her and i think that the little prince took advantage of the migration of a flock of wild birds to escape him the morning of his departure, he carefully put the planet in order carefully tidying up its active volcanoes of which he had two that were very useful for heating up breakfast every morning also had an extinct volcano chimney sweep also the extinct volcano because as he said you never know what can happen if the volcanoes are well swept their eruptions burn slowly and regularly the eruptions volcanic are like the fire in our chimneys it is evident that in our land there is no possibility of chimney sweeping the volcanoes men are too small that is why they give us so many troubles the little prince also started with a bit of melancholy the last sprouts of baobabs he thought he was not going never to return but all those jobs seemed extremely sweet that morning and when he watered the flower for the last time and prepared to put it under the shelter of the lantern he felt like crying goodbye he said to the flower it did not respond goodbye repeated the little prince the flower coughed but not because he had a cold i have been a fool he said at last the flower forgive me try to be happy he was surprised by the absence of reproaches and was puzzled
