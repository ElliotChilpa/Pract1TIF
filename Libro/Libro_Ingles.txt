elephant memory the hospital where he worked was the same one he had often accompanied his father to as a child an old convent with a parish clock on the facade a courtyard of rusty plane trees patients in uniform wandering around at random dizzy from tranquilizers the porters fat smile lifting his lips upwards as if he were about to fly from time to time metamorphosed into a ticket collector that jupiter with successive faces would appear at the corner of the ward with a plastic folder in his armpit holding out an imperative and pleading piece of paper the societys small share sir damn psychiatrists organized in police stations he always thought as he searched for the hundred escudos in the complication of his wallet damn the grand orient of psychiatry the pompous labelers of suffering the scumbags of the only sordid form of madness that consists of watching and persecuting the freedom of other peoples madness defended by the penal code of treaties damn the art of cataloguing anguish damn me he concluded as he pocketed the printed rectangle which i collaborate in paying with this instead of scattering bombs in the buckets of dressings and in the drawers of doctors desks to explode in a triumphant atomic mushroom one hundred and twentyfive years of pinamaniesque idiocy the intensely blue gaze of the gatekeeper who watched without understanding a low tide of revolt that transcended him enveloped him in the halo of a soothing medieval angel one of the doctors secret projects consisted of jumping foot to foot into cimabues paintings and dissolving himself in the faded ochres of an era not yet polluted by formica tables and the prayer books of the little saint to launch low dives like a partridge disguised as a mediocre seraph at the knees of virgins strangely identical to the women of delvaux mannequins of naked astonishment in stations where no one lives an agonizing remnant of fury came to swirl in his mouth mr morgado for the health of your family and mine dont screw me over with the damn quotas for another year and tell the society of neurology and psychiatry and related cerebellar amanuenses to put my money rolled up and covered in vaseline in the place they know how thank you very much and i said amen the doormancollector listened to him respectfully this guy must have been the sergeants favorite ped in the army the doctor discovered reinventing mendels laws to suit his tworoom intellect that served as a kitchen its obvious that the doctor is the doctors son one time his father threw the inspector out of the laboratory by the ears with his azimuth turned towards the score book and a delvaux breast fading into the corner of his mind the psychiatrist suddenly realized the admiration that his fathers military prowess had spread here and there in the longing of certain grey bellies boys his father called them when his brother and he started playing hockey for futebol benfica twenty years ago the coach who had shared with his father aljubarrotas golden years of beatings on the butt took the whistle out of his mouth to warn them seriously i hope they leave joão who when he played for santos was beaten up in 35 at the gomes pereira rink there were three from academica da amadora for são jose and he added softly with the sweetness of a grateful memory skull fracture in the tone of voice in which intimate secrets of adolescent passion are revealed kept in the drawer of memory that is dedicated to useless packaged items that give meaning to the past i belong irremediably to the class of meek people who take refuge in planks he reflected as he signed his name in the book that the attendant handed him a bald old man inhabited by the strange passion of beekeeping a diver in a hammock stranded on a reef of insects to the class of meek people who are lost and take refuge in planks dreaming of the pen of their mothers womb the only possible space in which to anchor the tachycardias of anguish and he felt as if he had been expelled and far from a house whose address he had forgotten because talking to his deaf mother seemed more useless to him than banging on a closed door to an empty room despite the efforts of the sonotone through which she maintained with the outside world a distorted and confused contact made up of echoes of screams and enormous explanatory gestures of a poor clown to communicate with this egg of silence the son would start a kind of zulu drumbeat with a rhythm of squeaks jump on the carpet distorting himself into rubber faces clap his hands grunt and end up sinking exhausted into a fat sofa like a diabetic who is averse to dieting and then moved by a sunflowerlike vegetal tropism the mother would lift her innocent chin from her knitting and ask huh with needles suspended over the ball of yarn like a chinese person stopping their chopsticks after an interrupted lunch class of the meek lost class of the meek lost class of the meek lost the steps repeated as he climbed them and the infirmary approached him like a urinal at a moving train station led by a sacred cow who in order to disarray the subordinates removed the false teeth in his mouth as if he were rolling up his sleeves to increase the effectiveness of his insults the image of his daughters visited on sundays in an almost furtive manner like leave from the barracks passed obliquely through his head in one of those beams of dusty light that attic shutters transform into a sad kind of joy he used to take them to the circus in an attempt to communicate his admiration for the contortionists intertwined like initials on a napkin and possessing the impalpable beauty common to the gauze breaths that announce the departure of planes in airports and to the girls in ruffled skirts and white boots tracing ellipses backwards on the skating rink at the zoo and he was disappointed by their strange interest in the equivocal ladies with blond hair with gray roots who trained melancholically obedient and uniformly hideous dogs or in the sixyearold boy tearing up telephone directories to the easy laughter of budding bodyguards the future mozart of the truncheon the skulls of those two tiny beings who shared his surname and extended the architecture of his features seemed as mysteriously opaque to him as the problems with taps at school and he was astonished that beneath hair that had the same smell as his own ideas different from those he had painstakingly stored away over years and years of hesitation and doubt were bubbling up he was surprised that in addition to tics and gestures nature had not also taken care to transmit to them as a bonus the poems of eliot that he knew by heart the silhouette of alves barbosa cycling on the penhas da saude and the lessons he had already learned from suffering and behind their smiles he discerned with alarm the shadow of future concerns just as on his own face if he looked closely he perceived the presence of death in the morning beard he searched the key ring that opened the door to the infirmary my side as a housekeeper he murmured my side as a steward on invented ships fighting with the rats for the biscuits in the hold and entered a long corridor marked by thick tombstones behind which lay on questionable bedspreads women who had been transformed by too much medicine into sleepwalking deceased infantas convulsed by the scorch of their ghosts the head nurse in her office as dr mabuse was replacing the false teeth in her gums with the majesty of napoleon crowning himself the molars when they clashed produced dull noises like plastic castanets as if their articulations were a mechanical creation for the cultural edification of high school students or the visitors to the ghost castle at the fair where the smell of grilled sardines subtly combines with the colic groans of the merrygorounds a pale twilight floated permanently in the corridor and the figures illuminated by the disjointed ceiling lamps acquired the texture of gaseous vertebrates of the rivegauche god of the catechism which he always imagined escaping from the penal colony of the commandments to walk freely in the city nights the biblical hair of an eternal ginsberg some old women whom napoleons mouth castanets had awakened from their stone lethargy were randomly shuffling from chair to chair like sleepy birds looking for a bush to anchor themselves in the doctor tried in vain to decipher in the spirals of their wrinkles which reminded him of the mysterious networks of cracks in vermeers paintings youths with waxed moustaches bandstands and processions culturally nourished by gervásio lobato by the advice of confessors and by the gelatinous dramas of dr julio dantas uniting fado singers and cardinals in rhyming marriages the octogenarians fixed their discoloured glass eyes on him hollow as fishless aquariums where the tenuous slime of an idea condensed with difficulty in the murky water of misty memories the head nurse her incisors sparkling herded that arthritic flock driving them with both hands into a small room where the television had broken down in a harakiri that was in solidarity with the rickety chairs against the walls and the radio that emitted with fortunately rare jerks long phosphorescent howls of a lost dog on a thursday night the old women gradually calmed down like chickens rescued from chicken soup in the coop once again at peace chewing the chewing gum in their cheeks in longwinded ruminations under a pious oleograph in which the humidity had devoured the biscuits of the saints halos early vagabonds of a celestial kathmandu the consulting room consisted of a dilapidated cupboard stolen from the attic of a disillusioned scrapyard two or three rickety maples with the lining protruding from the rips in the seats like hair through the holes in a beret a contemporary marquise from the heroic and consumptive era of dr sousa martins and a desk that housed in the cavity reserved for the legs an enormous wastepaper basket a wormeaten parturient afflicted by an excessive fetus on top of a stained doily a paper rose was stuck in its plastic vase like captain scotts distant flag in the ice of the south pole a nurse who looked like the queen maria ii on the campo de ourique banknotes brought a woman who had arrived the day before and whom he had not yet noticed towards the psychiatrist zigzagging with injections her shirt floating around her body like the ghost of charlotte brontë floating in the darkness of an old house the doctor read in the hospitalization report "paranoid schizophrenia; suicide attempt" quickly leafed through the emergency department medication and looked for a pad in the drawer while a sudden sun jovially adhered to the frames in the courtyard below between the buildings of the 1st and 6th mens wards a black man in kneelength trousers was masturbating frantically leaning against a tree watched with glee by a group of orderlies ahead near the 8th two guys in white coats were lifting the hood of a toyota to examine the workings of its oriental viscera these yellow bastards started out as traveling ties and now they are colonizing us with radios and cars and one day they will make us the kamikazes of future pearl harbor; mules to kick the horns in jeronimos in the summer saying banzai when weddings and baptisms follow one another at the frantic pace of a mystical machine gun the patient whoever comes here to give pills take pills or visit the pill victims in a nazarene way is sick the psychiatrist sentenced himself pointed the pillclouded eye sockets at his nose and said with tenacious determination you bastard d maria ii shrugged her shoulders in order to smooth over the edges of the insult shes been doing this since she arrived if he had seen the scene she caused there with her family the doctor would have crossed himself shes been calling us all sorts of things long and short the doctor wrote on the pad bastard short long he made a line underneath as if he were doing a sum and added in capital letters fuck the nurse who was looking over his shoulder took a step back bulletproof catholic education he supposed measuring it bulletproof catholic education and virgin by family tradition his mother must have been praying to saint maria goretti while she did it charlotte brontë staggering on the edge of the chemical knockout returned a nail where the nail polish was cracking to the window have you ever seen the sun outside you bastard the psychiatrist scribbled caralho bastard big fuck tore out the page and handed it to the nurse do you understand he asked i learned this from my first needlework teacher who by the way had the best clitoris in lisbon the woman stiffened in respectful indignation you are in a very good mood but i have other doctors to see the man gave him in a broad gesture the urbi et orbi blessing that he had once heard on television go in peace he spelled out with an italian accent and do not lose my papal message without having it read to the bishops my beloved brothers sursum corda and deo gratias or vice versa she closed the door carefully behind her and sat down again at her desk charlotte brontë eyed him critically i havent decided yet if youre a nice or nasty bastard but just in case mothers pussy mothers cunt he mused what an appropriate exclamation he moved it around in his mouth with his tongue like a caramel felt its color and warm taste went back in time until he found it in pencil in the high school bathrooms among explanatory drawings invitations and verses and the sickening memory of clandestine cigarettes bought loosely at the papelaria academica from a greek goddess who swept the counter with her excess breasts lingering on it with empty statuesque pupils a thin subordinatelooking lady was picking up knitwear in a dark corner announced by a large sign in the window knitwear with perfection and speed just as the posters pinned to the railings of the zoo announce the animals latin names it smelled persistently of viarco pencils and humidity and the ladies from the surrounding area with their purchases from the square wrapped in newspaper came to complain to the hellenic breasts in desolate murmurs about their marital miseries populated by perverse manicurists and french cabaret girls who seduced their husbands by bending four to the aphrodisiac rhythm of the midnight waltz the expert nakedness of their hips the black man who was masturbating in the courtyard began for the edification of the servants disorderly orgasmic contortions of the hose on the loose larroseur arrose tireless charlotte brontë returned to the charge listen you idiot do you know the owner of this place and after a pause intended to let the school panic of ignorance spread through the doctor he patted him on the stomach it is me the eyes that had been disdaining the psychiatrist suddenly became streaked with double decimeter metric dashes i dont know whether to fire him or appoint him director it depends is it consonant it is according to the opinion of my husband the bronze lion tamer marquis of pombal sebastião de melo we sell trained animals as statues bearded stone reformers for fountains unknown soldiers at home the man had stopped listening to her his body maintained the obsequious curve of a question mark in the attentive appearance of a third officer on duty his forehead where all the geographical features of his face converged like passersby for an epileptic lizard on the sidewalk was crumpled with aseptic professional interest the ballpoint pen awaited the stupid order of a definitive diagnosis but on the stage of his brains the dizzying and confused images followed one another in which sleep lasted into the morning fought off by the taste of toothpaste on the tongue and the false advertising freshness of shaving lotion unmistakable signs of already instinctively struggling in the reality of everyday life with no room for the somersault of a whim his imaginary zorro projects always dissolved before they began in the melancholic pinocchio that inhabited him to show the hesitation of the smile painted under the resigned line of his authentic mouth the doorman who woke him up every day with stubborn knocks of the bell seemed to him like a saint bernard with a barrel around his neck saving him in extremis from the snowstorm of a nightmare and the water from the shower as it ran down his shoulders washed away from his skin the sweat of anguish and hopelessness tenacious ever since he had separated from his wife five months earlier the doctor had been living alone in an apartment decorated with a mattress and a mute alarm clock that had been set to seven in the evening since birth a congenital malformation that he liked because he hated clocks whose metal interiors beat with the tachycardia of an anxious little heart the balcony looked out directly onto the atlantic over the casino roulette wheels where elderly american women tired of photographing the baroque tombs of kings were thronging showing off the skeletal freckles of their cleavage with the chilling audacity of renegade quakers lying on the sheets without lowering the blinds the psychiatrist felt his feet touch the darkness of the sea different from the darkness of the land due to the rhythmic restlessness that agitated it the factories of barreiro introduced the muscular smoke of distant chimneys into the lilac of dawn gulls without a compass bumped into the sparrows in the plane trees and the swallows on the china facades stupefied a bottle of brandy lit up the empty kitchen with the votive lamp of a cirrhotic happiness with clothes spread out on the floor the doctor learned that loneliness has the sour taste of alcohol without friends drunk from the bottle leaning against the zinc of the sink and he ended up concluding as he replaced the cork with a slap that he was like a camel stuffing his hump before crossing a long landscape of dunes which he would have preferred never to see it was at times like these when life becomes obsolete and fragile like the trinkets that greataunts distribute throughout small rooms impregnated with the mixed odor of cat urine and restorative syrup and from which they recreate the minuscule monumentality of the family past in the manner of cuvier creating terrifying dinosaurs from insignificant slivers of phalanges that the memory of his daughters returned to his mind with the insistence of a refrain that he could not shake off clinging to him like a sticky tape on a finger and produced in his belly the intestinal tumult of twisting of the guts in which longing finds the strange escape of a message of gases his daughters and the remorse of having escaped one night suitcase in hand as he descended the stairs of the house he had lived in for so long becoming aware step by step that he was abandoning much more than a wife two children and a complicated web of stormy but pleasant feelings patiently kept separate in todays era divorce replaces the initiatory rite of first communion the certainty of dawning the next day without the complicity of the toasts of shared breakfast for you the crumb for me the crust terrified him in the hall his wifes desolate eyes followed him down the stairs they moved away from each other as they had come closer thirteen years before in one of those augusts on the beach made of confused aspirations and anguished kisses in the same turbulent and ardent ebb of the tide her body remained young and light despite the births and her face maintained intact the purity of the cheekbones and the perfect nose of a triumphant adolescence next to that slender beauty of giacometti with makeup he always felt clumsy and rough in his shell that was beginning to yellow from a dull autumn there were times when it seemed unfair to him to touch her as if the contact of his fingers would awaken in her an unreasonable suffering and he would lose himself between her knees drowning in love stammering the words of tenderness in an invented dialect when did i get fucked the psychiatrist asked himself as charlotte brontë impassively continued her grandiose lewis carroll speech like someone who mindlessly puts their hand in their pocket looking for the tip of an answer he plunged his arm into the drawer of his childhood an inexhaustible bricabrac of surprises a theme on which his later existence traced variations of dull monotony and brought up by chance clear in the hollow of his palm him a little boy squatting on the chamber pot in front of the wardrobe mirror where the sleeves of his coats hung in profile like egyptian paintings proliferated in the abundance of soft vines of his fathers princes of wales a blond kid who alternately squirms and observes he thought giving a small nod to his wasted years here is a reasonable summary of the previous chapters they used to leave him like that for hours on end in his enamel sèvres cup where he would play timid harp scales chatting to himself the four or five words of a monosyllabic vocabulary filled with onomatopoeias and the squeaks of an abandoned marmoset while downstairs the antlike prong of the vacuum cleaner carnivorously sucked the edible fringes of the carpets handled by the caretakers wife whose autumnal appearance was accentuated by the discomfort of the gallstones when did i get fucked asked the doctor to the boy who was gradually dissolving with his stutter and his mirror to give way to a shy teenager with inkstained fingers leaning against a suitable corner to watch the indifferent and laughing passing of the high school girls whose socks shook him with confused but vehement desire drowned in solitary lemon teas in the neighboring bakery ruminating in a notebook on sonnets à la bocage policed by the strict censorship of his aunts catechism of good manners between these two stages of incipient larvae like a gallery of plaster busts there were sunday mornings in deserted museums marked by oil portraits of ugly men and stinking spittoons where coughs and voices echoed like in garages at night rainy summers in spas immersed in unreal fogs from which silhouettes of wounded eucalyptus trees were barely born and above all the opera arias on the radio listened to from his childhood bed duets of sharp insults between a soprano with the lungs of a fishwife and a tenor who unable to stand up to her ended up treacherously strangling her with the noose of an endless c in his chest giving the fear of the dark the dimension of little red riding hood written in a cello pencil grownups at that time possessed an undeniable authority endorsed by their cigarettes and their ailments disturbing queens and jacks of a terrible deck whose places at the table were recognized by the location of the medicine packets separated from them by the subtle political maneuver of giving me a bath while i never saw them nakedthe psychiatrist was content with the role of almost an extra that they gave him sitting on the floor of the room playing the cube games that are accepted as amusement of the vassals longing for the providential flu that would divert the cosmic attention of those titans from the newspaper to themselves suddenly transformed into a zeal for thermometers and injections the father preceded by the smell of brilliantine and pipe tobacco the combination of which for many years represented for him the magical symbol of a secure virility would enter the room with a syringe at the ready and after cooling his buttocks with a damp cotton shaving brush would introduce into his flesh a kind of liquid pain that solidified into a piercing stone they would reward him with empty penicillin bottles from which a trail of therapeutic perfume would waft just as from the closed attics through the cracks in the door the musty and lavender aroma of the dead past but he he he when did he get screwed he quickly leafed through his childhood since the remote september of the forceps that had expelled him from the peace of the uterine aquarium like someone pulling a healthy tooth from the comfort of the gums he lingered over the long months in beira illuminated by his grandmothers leafy dressing gown twilights on the veranda overlooking the mountains listening to the low smoldering of the monotonous fever of the drains sloping fields marked by railway lines identical to protruding veins on the back of a hand he skipped the boring dialoguefree pages of some deaths of elderly cousins that the rheumatic had bent over with horseshoe bows touching the gout spots on his knees with the strands of his white hair and he prepared to explore with a psychoanalytic magnifying glass in hand the anguished vicissitudes of his sexual debut between a bottle of permanganate and a dubious bedspread that kept alive next to the pillow the footprint of the yeti from the sole of the previous client too rushed to worry about the insignificant detail of shoes or prudish enough to keep his socks on that altar of metered gonorrhea when charlotte brontë woke him up to the present reality of the hospital morning by shaking both folds of his coat with her hands while at the same time intertwining the thick libertarian wool thread of the marseillaise into the neighborhood crochet of the alexandrine fado with the dexterous needles of an unexpected contralto her mouth round as a napkin ring showed in the background the trembling tear of her uvula swinging like a pendulum to the rhythm of her screams her eyelids drooping over her perceptive pupils like theater curtains that had been mistakenly lowered in the middle of a wisely ironic brecht the nylon cords of the tendons in his neck were straining under his skin and the doctor thought it was as if fellini had suddenly entered one of those beautiful paralyzed chekhov dramas in which gaseous seagulls wither away in suppressed pain behind the flickering flame of a smile and that beyond the closed door the maids must have begun to stir with solicitous anxiety imagining him hanging from the black elastic of a garter charlotte brontë satisfied perched herself on the marquises throne as if she had returned of her own accord to the uncompromising pride of exile you big fucking bastard she said in the distracted tone of a fiftyyearold woman talking to her friends counting the stitches she has knitted the psychiatrist hurried to take advantage of this favorable mood to sneak away to the trench of the dressing room a nurse he valued and whose calm friendship had more than once soothed the destructive impulses of his tidal furies was peacefully preparing lunch medications by pouring tablets identical to smarties into a tray full of plastic cups deolinda he informed her im hitting rock bottom she shook her face in a kindly turtle beak will this descent never end the doctor raised his cufflinks to the peeling limestone ceiling in a pathetic biblical plea hoping that his voluntary theatricality would hide some of his true suffering you find yourself observe me well fortunately for you and unfortunately for me in front of the greatest speleologist of depression eight thousand meters of oceanic depth of sadness blackness of gelatinous waters without life except for one or another repugnant sublunary monster with antennae and all this without a bathyscaphe without a diving suit without oxygen which obviously means that i am dying why dont you go home asked the nurse who had a practical sense of existence and the unshakable certainty that even though a straight line is not necessarily the shortest path between two points it is at least the best way to untangle tortuous spirits the psychiatrist picked up the phone and asked them to call the hospital where a friend worked it was time to grab onto anything he decided because i dont know because i cant because i dont want to because i lost the key he declared to the nurse knowing perfectly well that he was lying i lie and she knows that i lie and i know that she knows that i lie and she accepts it without anger or sarcasm the doctor said every now and then we are lucky enough to come across someone like that who loves us not in spite of our defects but with them in a love that is both merciless and fraternal the purity of rock crystal the dawn of may the red of velázquez look said the doctor covering the mouthpiece with his sleeve you cant imagine how grateful i am for you existing at that moment the friends voice came in a small voice over the phone and he carefully formulated is it and he imagined a delicate pair of tweezers gently picking up something fragile and precious its me he answered quickly because he felt himself starting to get emotional im hitting rock bottom rock bottom and i needed you in the silence of the phone he guessed his friend was mentally unraveling it in his head your days schedule i can arrange a lunch he announced finally we would go together to one of those mangers you frequent and unburden yourself over a hamburger at one in the galleries the psychiatrist decided looking at the nurse who was leaving with the tray full of red yellow and blue grains shaking in the plastic containers and thank you at one confirmed the friend the doctor put the phone down quickly enough not to hear the sound of the receiver hanging up a useless painful noise that reminded him of bitter arguments fueled by spite and jealousy he was adjusting the tie that charlotte brontë had messed up looking for the bisector of the collars when napoleon with the false teeth rattling hundreds of molars came to tell him that he had been called from the emergency room a halfnaked girl came running out of the bathroom opposite clutching a bundle of tattered newspapers we have to tighten the screw on nelia said the corso of the jaws removable you cant stand it just now you told me you wanted to see my blood running down the corridor of the infirmary your buttocks are full of lumps from the injections the doctor argued what can i do for you besides dont you find the idea of your blood being spilled poetic an end like caesar what more do you want and he added in a whisper of confidence what does the head of violent deaths think maybe theyll name a hospital wing after him after all miguel bombarda died from a gunshot wound from afar nelia sent them the most obscene gesture of her elementary school display some of the newspapers fell from her hands near a maid who was polishing the floor with a small machine similar to a schematic lawnmower who devoured the news immediately with the purring appetite of a boa constrictor coughed three or four times sobbed and froze against the wall in the spectacular agony of a cinematic king kong napoleon rushed to throw slippers at her as if he were a sick child the psychiatrist thought she would desperately try mouthtohole resuscitation and turned his back disgusted by this act of unnatural love is the polishing robot good in bed he asked the nurse who returned without smarties holding the empty tray devoid of the trembling charm of the tablets the more you know men the more you appreciate them household appliances she replied i live with a twoburner stove and we are happy the only shame is the iron lung of the gas cylinder in a mental asylum where are the lunatics the doctor insisted why do we drag ourselves here those of us who still have daily exit permits when every week there is a boat to australia and there are boomerangs that never return to the starting point “im too old and youre too young” the nurse explained “and boomerangs always end up coming back even if its on tiptoe at night with an embarrassed little whistle” return thought the psychiatrist repeating the word with the slow pace of a peasant wrapping himself in a thoughtful shroud in the afternoon of a wheat field return open the door with the literary simplicity of the gentle miracle and inform with a smile am i here return like an uncle from america a son of brazil a miracle worker from fátima with victorious crutches on his shoulder still illuminated by the vision of a celestial palm reader handling skillful biblical tricks on the stage of an oak tree return as he had returned years ago from the war in africa at six in the morning for a month of furtive happiness in a slanted attic making sure street by street in the taxi that nothing had changed in his absence a black and white country of whitewashed walls and widows in black of statues of regicides raising their carbonari arms in inhabited squares in equal doses of pensioners and pigeons both of whom had already forgotten the joy of flight the feeling of having lost the key even though he kept it in the glove compartment of his car among oilstained papers and tubes of sleeping pills made him experience the unfettered anguish of absolute solitude something he didnt know and that distorted his gestures prevented him from dialing the number that followed his name in the telephone book and calling for help from the woman he loved and who loved him the cruelty of this impotence rose to his eyes in a fog of acid that was hard to suppress like the turbulence of a burp the nurses fingers came to lightly touch his elbow maybe she said there are always boomerangs that dont come back and they manage to stay afloat anyway and it seemed to the psychiatrist that he had just received a kind of final last rites as he went down the stairs to the bank he could see in the distance near the dim sacristy smelling of nail polish in the social workers office ugly and sad creatures in need of urgent assistance themselves a group of medical propaganda representatives strategically hidden in the doorways of the neighbouring doors ready to assault with a barrage of verbal and sometimes lethal words the unsuspecting aesculapians within reach innocent victims of their imposing sympathy the psychiatrist compared them to car salesmen in their overly delicate and welldressed loquacity bastard brothers who had deviated following an obscure chromosomal accident along the way from the lineage of iodine headlights to ointments for rheumatism without however losing their original tireless and helpful vivacity he was astonished that these indebted beings always on their toes with good manners owners of obese briefcases that contained within them the secret capable of transforming rickety hunchbacks into triple jump champions would shower him with the attention of the three wise men bearing precious gifts of plastic calendars in favor of antisyphilis condoms donald the public enemy number one of demographic growth soft to the touch and with a crown of aphrodisiac hairs at the base of chess games on cardboard discreetly praising in every house the merits of einstein memory syrup three flavors strawberry pineapple and sirloin steak and of effervescent tablets that stopped diarrhea but freed the reins of heartburn forcing those with intestinal problems to worry about their stomachs boiling a diversionary tactic with which they profited from the quarts of pedras water drunk at small therapeutic sips at the counters of the pastry shops the doctors came out of their fierce grips staggering under the weight of leaflets and samples dizzy from speeches bristling with chemical formulas dosages and side effects and several fell exhausted after thirty or forty meters scattering the droplets of pills from their last breath an indifferent employee swept their clinical remains into the common grave of a dented garbage can muttering funeral ballads of a gravedigger taking advantage of the protection of two policemen who were escorting a dignified old man with the face of a notarys assistant wrapped in the confused canvas of a straitjacket the doctor safely passed through the threatening band of propagandists who were enticing him with the siren song of their unison smiles unfolded like accordions on their obsequious cheeks one of these mornings he thought theyll drown me in a bottle of tonsil antibiotic suspension the same way my father had i never understood why kept in the cupboard of the bookcase the hunting trophy of a scolopendra corpse in a tube of alcohol and theyll sell me to the faculty shriveled like an abortion to appear in the display case of horrors at the institute of anatomy a scientific butcher shop crossed by a ghost castle with skeletons hanging from vertical irons like withered carnations supporting their discouragement with pieces of cane looking at each other with the empty eyes of soldiers in reserve under the cover of the notarys assistants bridesmaids whose mustaches trembled with authoritarian shyness the psychiatrist got through unscathed an alcoholic inpatient of his acquaintances who every morning insisted on telling him in detail about endless marital disputes in which arguments were replaced by extremely lively pitched battles with saucepans wow i gave him a slap on the head you little doctor who spent eight days spitting out pomade a skinny lady from the secretarys office who lived in a panic about her husbands sperm and used to anxiously question him about the comparative effectiveness of two hundred and twentyseven different contraceptives and a patient with a beard as big as neptunes in lagos who nurtured an enthusiastic admiration for him made up of vociferous eulogies all kept at a respectful distance by the straightjacketed maids communicating in each others hairy ears their respective breaths of garlic he passed the gumdepopulating dentists office fighting with a tenacious molar and thought he was miraculously intact in the emergency room whose frosted glass door waved like the finishing flag of a bicycle race when a wicked finger imperiously touched him between the shoulder blades prominent triangular bones that attested by their shape to his past as an angel hidden beneath the fabric of his coat in a modest modesty of divine origins like the wellborn belch at the end of lunch as a benevolent social concession to a world of brambles my dear asked a voice behind him what do you mean by the communist conspiracy the police busy transporting the notarys assistant with the care of delivery boys carrying a strange piano that was constantly playing the sonatina riddled with wrong notes of his delusions of grandeur vilely abandoned the doctor next to the archive where a shortsighted lady lived with glasses as thick as paperweights which magnified her eyes to the proportions of gigantic shaggy insects surrounded by enormous eyelashlike legs at the mercy of a short colleague adrift in the lake in the cheviot of his overcoat with a tyrolean hat stuck on his head like a cork in a bottleneck in the vain attempt to prevent the stormy escape of the carbonated bubbles of his ideas the colleague brought the hand hook to the surface and instead of waving for help he hung on to his tie like an impatient castaway mistakenly hugging a blue water snake with white spots that was falling apart on his wrist with the soft inertia of a shoelace the psychiatrist thought that everyone that day wanted to separate him from one of the last gifts his wife had given him in a futile desire to improve his appearance as a provincial fiance frozen in a stiff posture like a fairground photograph since adolescence he had carried with him glued to the asymmetry of his features the false and sad look of family dead people in the photo albums portraits of smiles diluted by the iodine of time my love he said to himself feeling his tie i know this doesnt help or relieve but of the two of us i was the one who didnt know how to fight and he remembered long nights on the beach the sheets torn apart her tongue slowly tracing the contours of breasts illuminated by a network of veins in the first light of dawn the poet robert desnos dying of typhus in a german prison camp murmuring its my most morning morning john cages voice repeating every something is an echo of nothing and the way her body opened like a shell to receive him vibrating like the leaves on the pine tree tops shaken by an invisible and calm wind the little fellow with the feather of his tyrolean hat oscillating like the needle of a geiger counter finding ore forced him to run aground on a corner of a wall the sick man being held by the stubbornness of a tenacious shrimper his limbs jumped in his overcoat aimless brownian movements like flies in the sunspot of a cellar his sleeves multiplied in the dismayed gestures of a sacred orator the guys are advancing huh the communists the week before the doctor had seen him squatting down searching for kgb microphones hidden under his desk ready to transmit the decisive messages of his diagnoses to moscow theyre moving forward i assure you bleated the colleague spinning around in anxiety and this gang the troops the common people the church no one is moving theyre scared shitless they collaborate they consent as far as im concerned and my wife knows anyone who comes into my house will get shot in the horns with a shotgun olarila have you read the posters they put up in the hallway with the portrait of marx the economics hottie dumping his whiskers on us and coming closer confidentially ill admit that youre around there if you dont go along with the gang but at least wash yourself thats right your father is a professor at the college tell me do you see yourself eating at the table with a carpenter in my childhood the psychiatrist thought people fell into three strictly demarcated nonmiscible categories the maids gardeners and chauffeurs who ate lunch in the kitchen and got up when they passed by; the seamstresses and housekeepers who were entitled to a separate table and the consideration of a paper napkin; and the family who occupied the dining room and watched over their muzhiks “staff” as my grandmother called them in a christian way offering them used clothes uniforms and a distracted interest in the health of their children there was also a fourth category the “creatures” which included hairdressers manicurists typists and sergeants stepdaughters who hovered around the tribesmen weaving a sinful web of magnetizing sideways glances around them the "creatures" did not "marry" they "registered" they did not go to mass they did not worry about the huge problem of converting russia they devoted their demonic existences to pleasures that i barely understood in thirdfloor apartments without elevators from where my uncles would sneak back smiling with recovered youth while the females of the clan in the church headed for communion with their eyes closed and tongues hanging out chameleons ready to devour the mosquitoes in the hosts with mystical gluttony every now and then in the middle of the meal if the psychiatrist then a boy chewed with his mouth open or rested his elbows on the tablecloth my grandfather would point the definitive index finger at him and prophesy cavernously youll end up in the cooks hands like the turkey and the tremendous silence that followed endorsed with its white seal the imminence of this catastrophe answer ordered his colleague do you see yourself eating at the table with a carpenter the doctor looked at him with the effort of someone adjusting the image of an outoffocus microscope from the top of a pyramid of prejudices forty generations of the bourgeoisie were looking at him why not he said challenging the gentlemen with pearshaped bodies and the ladies with their abundant rounded busts who had laboriously crossed paths with each other in complex crochet hampered by the suspenders and the beards of their bodices to produce after a century of conjugal duties a descendant capable of such unthinkable revolts as that of a false set of teeth that would jump out of the glass of water in which it smiled at night to bite its own owner the colleague took two steps back astonished why not why not man you are an anarchist a marginal you make deals with the east you approve the handover of the overseas territories to the blacks what does this guy know about africa the psychiatrist wondered as the other a baker from aljubarrota with patriotism to the legion walked away shouting indignantly promising to save him a street lamp what does this fiftyyearold caramel know about the war in africa where he neither died nor saw anyone die what does this cretin of the post administrators who buried ice cubes in the anuses of blacks they didnt like know what does this idiot know about the anguish of having to choose between senseless exile and the absurd stupidity of pointless gunshots what does this animal know about napalm bombs about pregnant girls beaten by the pide about mines blooming under the wheels of trucks in mushrooms of fire about longing fear anger loneliness despair as always when he remembered angola a rush of disordered memories rose from his guts to his head in the vehemence of his contained tears the birth of his eldest daughter whispered over the radio to the detachment where he was stationed the first golden apple of his sperm long vigils in the improvised infirmary bending over the agony of the wounded leaving the sergeant exhausted to finish sewing the fabrics and finding outside a sudden expanse of unknown stars with his voice repeating inside him this is not my country this is not my country this is not my country the arrival on wednesdays of the mail plane and the fresh food the subtle and infinitely wise patience of the luchazes the sweat of malaria covering the kidneys with bands of sticky humidity the woman coming from lisbon with the baby with surprising green irises to travel with him to the bush her almost mulatto mouth smiling ediblely on the pillow magical names cuítocuanavale zemza do itombe narriquinha baixa do cassanj covered by the tall eyelashes of sunflowers on mornings as clear as bones of light bailundos kicked to the farms of the north são paulo de luanda imitating areeiro leaning against the bays mouth what does this idiot know about africa the psychiatrist wondered beyond the cynical and imbecile stubborn arguments of the popular national action and the seminar speeches of salazars mental boots a virgin without a uterus disguised as a man the son of two canons a patient once explained to me that i know that for twentyseven months i lived in the anguish of barbed wire on behalf of the multinationals i saw my wife almost die of falciparum i watched the slow flow of the dondo i had a daughter in malanj and the diamonds i skirted the bare hills of dalasamba populated at the top by the clumps of palm trees of the tombs of the jingas kings i left and returned with the shell of a uniform imposed on my body what do i know about africa the image of the woman waiting for him among the mango trees of marimba full of bats awaiting dusk appeared to him in a violently physical lurch of longing like an exploding viscera i love you so much that i dont know how to love you i love your body so much and what in you is not your body that i dont understand why we lost each other if at every step i find you if every time i kiss you i kiss more than the flesh you are made of if our marriage withered away with youth like others with old age if after you my solitude swells with your smell with the enthusiasm of your projects and the roundness of your buttocks if i suffocate with the tenderness i cannot speak of here in this moment love i say goodbye and call you knowing that you will not come and wishing that you will come in the same way that as molero says a blind man waits for the eyes he ordered by mail in the emergency room the patients in their pajamas seemed to float in the light of the windows like submarine travelers between two waters their movements slowed by the weight of tons of medicine an old woman in a nightgown resembling one of rembrandts final selfportraits floated ten centimeters above her bench like a stumbling bird losing the windy foam from its bones sleepy drunks transformed by the dregs into broken seraphs stumbled through the air every night the police the firefighters or the indignation of the family came to abandon as if in a final dumping ground those who tried in vain to jam the gears of the world by breaking the corner of the room discovering strange invisible creatures hiding in the walls threatening the neighbors with the bread knife or listening to the imperceptible whistle of the martians who little by little dress up as office colleagues to reveal to the other galaxies the imminent arrival of the antichrist there were also those who showed up alone starving offering their buttocks to the syringe in exchange for a bed to sleep in regular customers whom the doorman sent back with an imperious arm extended towards the statue of marshal saldanha to the trees of campo de santana which the darkness confused into a haze of embraced bodies here the doctor thought the ultimate misery flows the absolute solitude what we cannot bear within ourselves the most hidden and shameful of our feelings what in others we call madness which is after all ours and from which we protect ourselves by labeling it by squeezing it with bars by feeding it pills and drops so that it continues to exist by granting it permission to go out at the weekend and by guiding it towards a “normality” that probably consists only of being stuffed while alive when it is said he considered with his hands in his pockets observing the seraphs of the grapevine that psychiatrists are crazy one is touching the heart of the truth without knowing it in no specialty as in this one do we find beings with such corkscrew skulls treating themselves through sleep cures imposed by persuasion or by force on those who seek them out to seek themselves and dragging the anxiety of their sadness from office to office like a lame person carries his lame leg from straight to straight in search of an impossible miracle to dress people in diagnoses to listen to them without hearing them to stand outside them as if on the banks of a river whose currents fish and the hollow rock from which it springs are unknown to watch the whirlwind of the flood without getting your feet wet to recommend a pill after every meal and a pill at night and to be satisfied with this scouts feat what makes me belong to this sinister club he mused and suffer daily remorse for the weakness of my protests and my resigned nonconformity and to the extent to which the certainty that the revolution is made from within does not work in me as an excuseselfviatic to continue giving in these were questions that he could not answer clearly and that left him confused and distressed within himself bristling with questions doubts scruples when he had entered there at the beginning of his internship and they had taken him to visit the decrepit hideous building of the hospital of which he had only known the courtyard and the facade he had thought of himself as a provincial mansion inhabited by fellinis ghosts propped up by walls dripping with sticky humidity nearly naked feebleminded people masturbated in rocking movements turning their toothless mouths towards him with astonishment; men with shaved heads lay in the sun begging or lighting cigarettes whose shrouds were pieces of newspaper blackened by spit; old men rotted on the rotten mattresses empty of words hollow of ideas trembling vegetables lasting only; and there was the pen of 8 the infirmary and the people restrained by the irons slow apes grinding out disjointed sentences randomly running aground in the holes in the corral where they slept and here i am the doctor said collaborating or not collaborating with the continuation of this with the terrifying sick machine of mental health crushing in the egg the little seeds of freedom that are born within us in the clumsy form of a restless protest agreeing through my silence the salary i receive the career they offer me how can i resist from within almost without help the effective and soft inertia of institutional psychiatry inventor of the great white line separating “normality” from “madness” through a complex and false network of symptoms of psychiatry as gross alienation as revenge of the castrated against the penis they do not have as a real weapon of the bourgeoisie to which i belong by birth and which is so difficult to deny hesitating as i hesitate between comfortable immobility and painful revolt the price of which is paid dearly because if i have no parents who will come to the wheel wanting to adopt me the party proposes to me the replacement of one faith by another faith of one mythology by another mythology and at this point i always remember blondins mothers phrase "i dont have faith but i have so much hope" and i turn left at the last moment in the anxious expectation of finding brothers who will help me and whom i can help for them for myself and for the rest and it is the rest what is not listed out of modesty that is important like a kind of bet a winlose bet with a one in three hundred chance of believing in snow white and having real little dwarves appear from under the furniture to show us that it is still possible it is possible here and abroad that the hospital walls are concentric and encompass the entire country all the way to the sea to cais das colunas and its waves tamed like a portuguese river master of gentle furies reflecting the color of the sky and stained by the greasy shadow of the clouds my remorse the poet calls it my remorse for all of us concentric walls he repeated a labyrinth of houses and streets a steep and awkward descent of a woman in high heels into the horizontal expanse of the bar walls so concentric that they never actually break instead taking root in crochet in the carpet of the upper floor a tiled crete inhabited by window parrots and chinese men in ties busts of heroic regicides fat pigeons and castrated cats where the lyricism disguises itself as a canary in a cane cage releasing the trills of domestic sonnets the bertrand almanac serves as the bible pets are chrome plated bambis and porcelain puppies that nod yes funerals are the consistent mass of the family he felt his tie again checked the knot my natural silk samson hair he murmured without smiling one day ill buy a freak bead necklace and a set of indian bracelets and create a katmandu just for myself with rabindranah tagore and jack kerouac playing brisca with the dalai lama he took a few steps towards the offices and saw the notarys assistant in the straightjacket sitting at a desk explaining to an invisible doctor that he had been robbed of the milky way the policemen standing leaned over the railing of their belts to listen better like neighbors watching a street scene from their balcony one of them notebook in hand was taking notes with his tongue out on a childrens app the old woman levitating on the bench passed him fluttering like an exhausted partridge she smelled of stagnant urine of loneliness and of abandonment without soap the smells of misery the doctor opined the monotonous shitty and tragic smells of hunger and misery in the room reserved for treatments the nurses were discussing leaning against the stretcher the dressing cart the glass medicine cabinet the curious events of the last general workers assembly during which the barber and one of the drivers had called each other son of a bitch blind boy and fucking torch one of them with a syringe ready was preparing to inject an alcoholic with a disdainful expression holding his trousers at knee height in a patient waiting for a veteran of those adventures his very thin legs disappeared under fringes of grey hair that surrounded his hanging empty testicles and the crumpled rag of skin of his penis a mediterranean light haloed the balcony railings as if they were bathing in an aquarium illuminated by the intense lamp of an unreal spring good morning ladies and gentlemen girls and boys respectable audience said the psychiatrist i heard that you called upstairs worried as good mothers are asking for the helpful services of a gravedigger i am an employee of the funeral home a primorosa da ajuda candles candles and urns and i have come to measure the coffin i hope because i joined the union and i hate my bosses that the deceased has risen again and gone out to cheer for blessed luis gonzaga the nurse with the syringe with whom he used to have supper when they were both on shift with the cheesy shrimps that the servant bought in a beer shop in martim moniz stuck the therapeutic banderilla in the drunk to calm his momentarily calm moods of a tide that is preparing to spring a jump and passed a solemn bishops cotton wool to chrism the skin of his buttock like a good student erasing the result of an easy exercise from the board too much for his acrobatic capabilities the patient pulled the nastro belt up so violently that it broke and stood there staring in astonishment at the piece that fell from his hand with the astonishment of an astronaut staring at a piece of lunar algae you ruined the pasta for lunch applauded the nurse whose reserve of tenderness was hidden under a sarcasm too obvious to be genuine the doctor had learned to respect him by watching the courage with which he fought the hospitals inhuman concentration camp machine with the means at his disposal the nurse washed the syringe by pressing the plunger several times placed it in the kettle heated by the narrow blue tulip of the gas burner and wiped his fingers on the torn towel hanging from a clamp he did all this with the slow methodical gestures of a fisherman for whom time is not divided into hours like a ruler into centimeters but has the continuous texture that gives life unexpected intensity and depth he had been born by the sea in the algarve and had lulled his hunger in childhood with moorish winds near albufeira where the ebb tide leaves the sweet smells of a diabetic on the beach the alcoholic forgotten went out into the corridor dragging his shapeless sandals hannibal said the psychiatrist to the nurse who was searching the pockets of his coat for matches like a dog searching for the spot where he had buried a precious bone you called upstairs and promised that if i came here you would give me a strawberry lollipop i was pissed off with you because i only like the peppermint ones the nurse ended up finding the matches under the pile of circulars piled up on a white wooden table whose paint was crumbling in powdery patches of dandruff we have an oldfashioned nuisance here he said scratching the sandpaper with unusual anger the holy family wants to eat the baby jesus in a bad way only the mothers goat is worth a wellcooked quince poem hold on to the handrail the three of them are waiting for you in the back office the doctor examined a wall calendar petrified in a very old march when he still lived with his wife and daughters and a veil of joy lightly tinged each second whenever he was called to the bank he would visit that march of yesteryear in a kind of disenchanted pilgrimage and he tried unsuccessfully to reconstruct days of which he retained a memory of diffuse happiness diluted in a uniform feeling of wellbeing gilded by the oblique light of dead hopes when he turned around he noticed that the nurse was also looking at the calendar in which a blonde girl and a very fat black man were performing complicated operations naked the woman or the month the psychiatrist asked him the woman or the month what replied the nurse thats what youre pointing your headlights at the psychiatrist explained neither one nor the other explained the nurse i was just thinking about what we do here seriously there may come a time when this gaita changes and we can look at things with clear eyes where tailors are not obliged by decree to hide a mans balls in the width of his trousers and he began to clean already washed syringes with a fierce activity a cuckold from the algarve the doctor thought you look like a neorealist poet who changes the world with the verses he hides in a drawer or maybe youre a wise peasant from the estuary waiting for dusk to go fishing by lamp with a lantern hidden in the boats nets and he remembered praia da rocha in august when he had gotten married the rocks carved by henry moore from successive ebb tides the vast expanse of sand without footprints and how he and his wife had felt like robinson crusoe despite the cubic german tourists the androgynous englishwomen like castrated sopranos the elderly american women covered in incredible hats and the smoked lens glasses of the national pimps latin lovers with plastic combs in the back pocket of their trousers prowling around buttocks in the manner of hyenas boss he said to the nurse we might live for this but if we wait sitting down damn it we both will be damned he went to the cubicle at the back with the feeling that he had been unfair to the other man and the desire for him to understand that he had only offended the passive part of himself the part of him that accepted things without fighting and against which he rebelled do i like myself or not like myself he thought to what extent do i accept myself and at what point does the censorship of my protest really begin the policemen now outside had taken off their caps and seemed to the psychiatrist suddenly naked and harmless one of them was carrying the notarys assistants straitjacket in his arms clutched to his chest like someone holding his nephews jacket at the entrance to a gym class in the office the family was preparing for the attack the father and mother standing flanked their sons chair with the motionless hostility of stone dogs at a gate ready to bark out loud and angry complaints the doctor walked silently around the desk and pulled out the glass ashtray the hospitals stamped notebook the caixas credentials and the book in which the patients were registered like a chess player preparing the pieces for the start of the game the baby jesus redhaired and with the air of a distressed bird bravely pretended not to notice his presence staring at the sad buildings on gomes freire through the open window frowning his eyelids covered in transparent freckles “so whats up” asked the doctor cheerfully feeling his question like a referees whistle that would start a bloody game if i dont protect the boy he thought quickly glancing at the boy in a stillcontrolled panic theyll tear him apart in two bites the generation of cogitus interruptus he thought damn i need umberto ecos help the father pumped the front of his shirt sir doctor he said with the pomp of a declaration of war your honor is aware that this bastard is on drugs and he rubbed his obsequious hands together as if he were talking to the head of the department on his longnailed little finger next to his wedding ring he wore an enormous black stone ring and on his tie with golden branches was a coral pin depicting a belenenses football player kicking a golden ball he looked like a car with lots of accessories blankets on the seats trinkets a stripe on the bonnet the name to ze painted on the door according to his credentials he was an employee of the water company a clean employee at least the psychiatrist decided and his breath smelled of the shad soup from the day before it was time to change the color of the files the doctor thought dreamily pointing to three metal parallelepipeds that occupied the space between the door and the window with their hideous smoothness “a green like this would be enough to make an admiral die dont you think” he asked the boy who was still dazzled by the wonders of avenida gomes freire but whose lips were trembling like the belly of a terrified sparrow hold on tight the doctor advised him mentally hold on tight youre a weakling and the ordeal hasnt even started yet and he switched the position of the ashtray with the book in a strategic rock muttering “hold on to your underwear dona alzira the nato squadron is coming” at that moment he heard an unexpected rustling on the blotter on his desk his mother was emptying the contents of a paper bag full of various medicine packets under his surprised nose and arching her body clad in a plastic leopard coat towards him tense with furious indignation the sentences came out of her mouth like the cannonballs from the tin cannonball that had been given to the psychiatrist when he was little during one of his numerous bouts of angina my son has to be committed immediately she ordered in the tone of a reform school mayor cosmically addressing the moral disorder of the universe pills are what you see hes repeating the fourth grade hes disrespectful to his parents he answers crookedly if he answers the neighbor downstairs told me that they saw him in rato with some wretched woman i dont know if im explaining myself well whoever wants to understand let them understand this was when he was sixteen sir in april he was born by caesarean section by a hairs breadth that i was even on a drip there and we were raising him the good way spending money buying books talking to him in soft words being fed the whole time admit it do you agree and the doctor who probably also has children asks you about the files pause to take a breath of air into the buoys of her breasts between which lived an enamel heart with a photograph of her subordinate husband younger but already profusely adorned with amulets and another dive into the steaming waters of the angry a few weeks in hospital is what he needs to get back on his feet i had a sisterinlaw in the 3rd i know the methods a few weeks without going out without meeting his gang without pharmacies on hand to steal pills its a shame that no one puts an end to this since salazar died weve been going from disaster to disaster the doctor remembered many years before when they had returned from an aunts dinner they had found a pide agent in their fathers office waiting for his brother who presided over the law students association and the fearful repulsion that the man looking at the spines of his absent fathers neurology treatises with the ease of a proprietor had kindled in them only the youngest looked at the owl without hatred astonished by the arrogant desecration of that shrine of pipes that one entered with the awareness of the almost sacred importance of the place and he circled the apostate admiringly sniffing his gestures suddenly the doctor felt like grabbing our ladys blond painted head and banging it repeatedly unhurriedly deliberately against the corner of the washstand to his left beneath the oblique mirror that seen from the desk reflected a grey blind patch of wall as if the hexagonal surface that had so often brought him back to himself had been struck by some kind of cataract it was disconcerting not to find glued to the tinted glass pupil the inquiring curve of her chester cat smile a hospital or a prison said the harpys husband in a pompous voice stroking his monstrous tie pin we cant handle it the woman shook her wrist like a chestnut seller as if to sweep away the useless words she was the one who led the operations and would not accept sharing of command granddaughter of a corporal in the republican guard thought the psychiatrist moral heir to her fathers knack for beating the people “doctor be patient but you have to resolve this now” she said ruffling the false fur on her coat “do me a favor and keep it because i dont want it in the house” the kid started a movement that she cut off pointing her furious finger at him dont interrupt me you idiot im talking to the doctor and to the psychiatrist definitively solve things as you see fit but we wont get out of here with him the doctor advanced the pawn of a stapler on the desk tray service rosters some with his name on them our printed name no longer belongs to us he thought it becomes impersonal and alien it loses the familiar intimacy of handwriting impaled on rusting nails decorated the walls hold the horses outside so i can talk to the boy he said without looking at anyone in a pale dead mans tone his friends avoided arguing with him at moments like that when his tone became neutral and colorless and the blue of his eye sockets seemed to be emptied of light and i want the door closed closed doors closed doors the psychiatrist and his wife always left the one to their daughters room open and sometimes while they made love the confused words of their dreams would mix with their moans in a braid of sounds that united them in such an intimate way that the certainty of never being able to separate seemed to soothe the fear of death replacing it with a reassuring sensation of eternity nothing would be different from what it was then their daughters would never grow up and the night would stretch out in an enormous silence of tenderness with the cat sprawled out asleep next to the radiator clothes lying haphazardly on the chairs and the faithful company of familiar objects he thought about how the blanket on the bed was covered with white spots of sperm and vaginal cones and how there were always traces of mascara on his wifes pillow he thought about her indescribable expression when she came or when sitting on him she would cross her hands behind her neck and turn her body from side to side in order to feel his penis better with her large breasts swaying gently on his narrow torso gts said to him without speaking sitting at the hospital desk recovering the morse code through which they communicated without anyone else understanding gts to the end of the world my love now that we are already pedro and inês in the crypts of alcobaca waiting for the miracle that will come and he remembered to avoid the imminent danger of tears imagining that the hair of the stone infantas grew into their heads in dusty braids and that he had written this in one of the notebooks of poems that he periodically destroyed like certain birds eat their children with sickening cruelty he increasingly hated getting emotional a sign that i was getting older he realized fulfilling his mothers phrase thrown into the air of the room with prophetic solemnity with a temper like that youll end up alone as a dog and the framed portraits seemed to agree with him nodding in yellowish agreement the baby jesus who had not stopped staring at botelho glued to the window glanced quickly at the doctor who was returning from his inner story to the reason why he was there grabbed the boys hostility like someone jumping at the last second onto the running board of a moving tram what do you have in the lollipop box he asked from the tingling in his nostrils he could tell that the boy was hesitating and threw his cards in remembering the instructions for saving shipwrecked people from his childhood posters posted in the beach changing room with men with moustaches and striped swimsuits swimming over five columns of tiny prose of warnings and prohibitions look he said to the kid i hate this as much as you do and this isnt bullshit cool cop at the police station even if your old men pointed a cannon at my horns youd be stuck here but it might be a good idea if you explained a little bit of whats going on maybe the two of us together will understand some of this shit maybe we wont and neither of us has anything to lose by trying it out the redhead had returned to contemplating the window he considered within himself what had been said to him and decided to remain silent his pink eyelashes sparkled in the light like the threads of spider web that hold together the rafters in attics i need you to help me so i can help you insisted the psychiatrist each one to his own side wont get us far and im speaking to you with clean hands youre lonely and broke and your parents are out there wanting to stick you in here damn it the only thing i ask of you is that you collaborate with me to prevent that and dont just stand there like a startled ferret the baby jesus with his mouth tight continued to study gomes freire and the psychiatrist realized how stupid it would be to continue he pulled back the staplers handle feeling the pleasant cold of the metal on his skin rested his palms on the green blotter and finally got up with the reluctance of a lazarus awakened by an inopportune christ as he left he ran his fingers through the boys hair and his skull shrank into his shoulders like a turtle hurriedly hiding in its shell theres not much that can be done for this guy and for me thought the psychiatrist we both find ourselves albeit in different ways at the bottom of the bottom where no arm can reach and as our lungs run out of oxygen goodbye maria i just hope i dont drag anyone down this fall he opened the door suddenly and found the boys parents leaning over the lock peering childishly they both stood up straight as quickly as they could recovering the dignity of adults by force and the doctor almost looked at them with a kind of pity the same feeling that visited him every morning when he observed the bearded face in which he barely recognized himself a worn out caricature of himself the nurse having finished lunch approached close to the wall dragging the slippersclogs he usually wore when on duty the snoring close by of the alcoholic giving the injection resembled the rhythmic creaking of damp soles you are going to take the boy home said the psychiatrist to the redheads parents you are going to take your son home quietly and calmly and come back here on monday for a long quiet talk because this is a subject for long and timely talks without rushing and take advantage of sunday to look inside each other and the goldfinch in the cage look deep inside each other and the goldfinch in the cage minutes later he was in the hospital courtyard next to his small dented always dirty car my tiny mobile bunker my shelter any day now he decided ill really lose transmontana and put a china swallow on the bonnet when he entered the restaurant almost running because the clock in the neighboring garage was showing a quarter past one his friend was already waiting for him on the other side of the glass door examining the detective books that were piling up on a sort of rotating shelf made of wire metal pine fertilized by a manure of rightwing newspapers piled on the floor the foxfaced waitress from the tobacconists protected by a wall of magazines was practicing her schematic english for benevolent camones with a middleaged couple who were surprised by that strange slang whose hazy recognition of the occasional word or two the fox completed his speech with a large copy of roberto de feiras exemplary gestures the others retorted to him in a grimacing morse and his friend who had abandoned his books watched fascinated by this frenetic ballet of beings who would remain irremediably strange despite their strenuous efforts to find each other in a common language the psychiatrist desperately wished for an esperanto that would abolish the external and internal distances that separate people a verbal device capable of opening windows in the morning into the deep nights of each creature just as certain poems by ezra pound suddenly show us the attics of ourselves in a dazzling revelation the certainty of having found a traveling companion on a bench that at first seemed empty and the joy of unexpected sharing one of the things that brought him closest to his wife was precisely the fact that he could achieve this with her without even needing to dress himself up in phrases the ability to understand each other at a glance which had nothing to do with knowing each other because it had been like that since the first time they met they were both still very young and had been astonished by the strange hidden power of that miracle that had happened to no one else a union so perfect and so profound that he thought if his daughters ever achieved it it would have been worth it for him to have made them and for them all the measles of life would find a reason the eldest in particular frightened him he feared the fragility of her untimely rages her multiple fears the tense and attentive green eyes on cranachs face because he had been at war in africa he had never felt her move in her mothers womb and for months he had painted for her a portrait in the living room that they pointed to with their fingers devoid of relief and thickness of flesh in the fleeting kisses they exchanged there lived as it were a remnant of that mutual resentment barely contained on the verge of tenderness the melancholic admiral who was dragging his pension along with him next to the restaurants tobacco shop dreaming of trembling indians in the distance opened the glass door to let two competentlooking men pass both wearing glasses one of whom said to the other i left him with a clean slate you know how i am i trotted over to the guys office and said straight away if you bastard dont send me back to my section you wont have a single piece of shit left i just wanted you to see that piece of shit shitting himself what makes the admiralporters the doctor thought exchange the sea for restaurants and hotels with bridges reduced to the proportions of wornout doormats and extending their curved hands towards the tips like the elephant in the garden stretches its trunk towards the keepers bunch of carrots georges is watching my country of sailors sailing in the insipid waters of resigned subservience on the sidewalk the men with glasses waved to an empty taxi like castaways to an indifferent boat the middleaged couple tried with the help of a grammar catechism to exclaim in zulu in which echoed distorted remote similarities to linguaphone portuguese such as my uncles yard is bigger than your brothers pencil the psychiatrist who had taken advantage of the shipwrecked sailors departure to enter the hall of the galleries in profile like the egyptians in the history of matoso responded with an approximate salute to the admirals indefinite bow and was surprised as he always was that the sailor did not deposit a drop of spit on his middle finger and raised it to study the direction of the wind like the corsairs with their orbits blocked in the films of his childhood he and i are middleaged sandokans thought the doctor whose adventure consists of deciphering the obituary page of the newspaper in the hope that the omission of our name guarantees that we are alive and in the meantime we are breaking apart by fractions the hair the appendix the gallbladder some teeth like disassembled parcels outside the wind was moving the branches of the plane trees just as he had touched the boys head in the hospital and behind the penitentiary a thick grey of threats was gathering his friend touched him lightly on the elbow he was tall young a little stooped and his eyes had a serene vegetal softness my grandfather was there for a hell of a lot of months the psychiatrist informed him indicating with his chin the prison building and the cardboard wall along marquês da fronteira now dark with the approaching rain he was there for a hell of a lot of months after the monsanto revolt a monarchist troop you know until the end he signed the debate my father used to tell us how he would go to visit him with my grandmother at the hut and they would walk up the avenue in the summer crushed by the heat he dressed like a sailor like a barrel organ monkey she with a hat and umbrella pushing her pregnant belly in front of her like florentino the freight boy carried pianos around benfica in a huge wheelbarrow no seriously look at the picture the blueeyed german woman whose father committed suicide with two pistols sat at the desk behind her and the boy cramped in his carnival uniform a duet on the way to a mustachioed captain who came down from the fort with a wounded man on his back until he ran aground on the rifles of the carbonari you cant even make out their features in the oval photographs of that fiery time and when we were born salazar had already transformed the country into a domesticated seminary when i was at school said the friend the teacher who smelled bad from her clubbed feet told us to draw the animals in the zoo and i did the same dog cemetery do you remember what its like the alto de são joão of the poodles sometimes i get the idea that the whole of portugal is a bit like that the bad taste of nostalgia in diminutive and barking buried under lousy tombstones to our mondego the eternal longing for your leninha declared the doctor to the beloved biju of the owners who never forget him milu and fernando replied the friend now said the psychiatrist they replace the funerals of the mongrels with thanks to the divine holy spirit or the infant jesus of prague in the diário de notícias land of the sly if king d pedro were to return to the world he would not find anyone in the entire kingdom to castrate one is already born a commercial invalid and we reduce our ambitions to the first prize in the draw of the joão de deus league of the blind a sly ford capri on top of a truck blaring from loudspeakers the friend brushed his blond beard against the doctors shoulder he looked like an environmentalist who had generously granted the bourgeoisie the gift of a tie have you been writing he asked from month to month he would suddenly ask himself this terrifying question because for the psychiatrist handling words constituted a kind of secret shame an obsession eternally postponed as long as i dont do it i can always believe that if i do it ill do it well he explained and make up for my many lame centipede legs you see but if i start a serious book and give birth to shit what excuse do i have you might not give birth to shit argued the friend i can also win the house of christmas eve without buying the magazine or be elected pope or score free kicks in a packed stadium let me know that after i die you will publish my unpublished works with an explanatory preface soandso as i knew him you will call yourself max brod and you can call me franz kafka in the privacy of your bed they had left the admiral blowing his nose tumultuously into the candle in his handkerchief and had chosen the middle floor which the doctor preferred because of the incubatorlike hue of the light with lamps hidden in brass tubes people ate shoulder to shoulder like the apostles at the last supper and on the other side of the horseshoes on the counters the waiters were bustling about in a frenzy of insects uniformed in white led by a man in civilian clothes with his hands behind his back who reminded the psychiatrist of the building inspectors watching the workers galley efforts with toothpicks in their teeth he had never understood the reason for these authoritarian and silent creatures observing the work of others with the pupils of a sea bream leaning against gigantic blue mercedes his friend leaned over to pick up the menu which was placed on a metal rail over jars of mustard and various sauces the beauty products of cooking the doctor thought opened it with cardinals unction and began to quietly read the names of the dishes on a small piece of paper fradesco he had never allowed anyone to share in this voluptuous operation while the psychiatrist was more interested in the prices an inheritance from his parents house where the soup multiplied indefinitely meal after meal in a watery prodigy one day when he was already a man a bottle of wine appeared on the table and his mother explained sharing her clear eyes with her astonished offspring now thank god we can my old lady he thought my old lady we never knew how to get along with each other right from the moment you were born i almost killed you with eclampsia i was taken away from you with irons and from your perspective i have been stumbling through the years towards some final but certain misfortune my eldest son is crazy you would announce to visitors to excuse my to you bizarre behavior my inexplicable melancholies the verses i secretly secreted cocoons of sonnets for a formless anguish the grandmother to whom i went on sundays with my mind fixed on the maids buttocks and who lived in the shadow of the glory and decorations of two deceased generals would warn me painfully at steak time you kill your mother and do i kill you or do i kill myself my old woman who for so long seemed like my sister small pretty fragile a shepherdess of stained glass and the mist of sardinha whose schedule was divided between proust and parismatch a mother of male heirs who left you intact in the leanness of your hips and the fine wire of your bones perhaps i inherited from you the taste for silence and the successive bellies did not allow you the space to love me as i needed as i wanted until when we realized our existence face to face you my mother and i your son it was too late for what in my way of feeling had not existed the taste of silence and staring at each other like strangers separated by an impossibletoabolish distance what will you really think of me of my unformulated desire to reenter your womb for a long dreamless mineral sleep a stonelike pause in this race that terrifies me and that from the outside would seem to be imposed on me a frantic trot of anguish towards the rest that does not exist i kill myself mother without anyone or almost anyone noticing swinging on the rope of a smile crying inside the humidity of a cave the sweat of granite the secret fog in which i hide silence even in the background music of the restaurant rennies lozenge in the treble clef to help digestions that are swallowed in a hurry for ostriches that share pizzas against the clock background music that always reminds me of flounders of spiny eagles wallowing in the sands of the score with their honeyed little eyes observing the aquarium protrudingly the lull of resigned intestines the friend finally managed to capture the interest of an employee who was vibrating with impatience spurred on by multiple calls like a horse stung by simultaneous and contradictory orders shaking the thin mane of his hair distressed indecision what do you choose he asked the doctor who was fighting for his meter of counter space with an enormous obese lady occupied by the pyramid of an enormous obese ice cream baroque of crystallized fruits with which he fought fiercely with great blows of the spoon it was not clear which of the two would devour the other hamburger with rice said the psychiatrist without looking at the missal of fish and meat in which latin had given way to a french of casseroles dictated by the prima donna authority of the cook pemican oh pale face my brother before entering the prairie of eternal hunts a hamburger and a leg of pork his friend translated to the waiter almost bursting with despair another minute thought the doctor and earthquake cracks will open up in his cheeks and he will disintegrate on the floor in a crash syncope of an old building he said loudly syncope of a valmor prize attacked by leprosy and woodworm the ice cream lady swerved towards him with the sideways glance of a stray dog ready for a fight fearing that her rummaging through edible garbage was threatened first the whipped cream and then the metaphysics reflected the psychiatrist what asked the friend what what asked the doctor you moved your mouth and i didnt hear a sound said the friend like the devout women in churches i was thinking that writing is a bit like doing artificial respiration moraes dictionary the 4th grade grammar and the remaining tombs of dead words and i sometimes full and sometimes empty of oxygen dumbfounded with doubts in front of them a crosseyed girl identical to a sparrow in heat whispered confidential giggles to a fortyyearold man who was curled up like a shell to receive her bouncy guffaws the psychiatrist would almost bet that the man had been a priest given the lack of sharpness in his gestures and the soft curve of his lips into which he inserted pieces of bread in a steady metronome rhythm chewing slowly and slowly like a camel dull slow squint came from his eyelids and the crosseyed girl amazed nibbled on a piece of his ear with her rotten teeth like a giraffe extending its thick tongue over the bars towards the eucalyptus leaves a second employee who looked like harpo marx pushed the slices of roast pork and the hamburger onto the paper towels with his fork in hand the doctor felt like a calf tied to the manger that he shared with other calves all imprisoned by the tyranny of their jobs with no time for joy or hope work the sunday car ride along the inevitable triangle of casasintracascais work again the car ride again and so on until a funeral carriage catches us by surprise at the corner of the heart attack and ends the cycle at the final stop of prazeres hurry up please quickly he prayed with his whole body to the god of his childhood a bearded bogeyman a close friend of his aunts the landlord of the lame sacristan of nelas a divine pigeon fancier who owned the alms boxes and the expedite saints of the side altars with whom he maintained the disillusioned relationship of lovers who expect little from each other as no one answered him he ate the only mushroom that decorated the hamburger and which resembled a molar yellowed from lack of toothpaste from his friends silence he could tell that he was waiting for the explanation of the morning phone call with his usual patience of a quiet tree ive reached the bottom said the psychiatrist the mushroom still on his tongue remembering that when he was little in catechism he had been warned that it was a horrible sin to speak before swallowing the host the bottom of the bottom you snitch the bottom of the bottom of the bottom next to the crosseyed woman an elderly gentleman was reading the selections while waiting for lunch i am johns testicle why would a sixtyyearold man want testicles ive reached the bottom of the pit continued the psychiatrist and im not sure ill be able to get out of the mud im in im not even sure theres a way out for me you know sometimes id hear the patients talking and id think about how that guy or that girl would get themselves into the pit and i couldnt find a way to pull them out because of the short length of my arm like when as a student they showed us cancer patients in the wards clinging to the world by the navel of morphine id think about the anguish of that guy or that girl id get medicine and words of comfort from my astonishment but i never thought id one day join the ranks because damn it i had strength i had strength i had a wife i had daughters the project of writing concrete things lifebuoys to keep me afloat if i was feeling a little anxious at night you know how it is i would go to the girls room to that mess of childrens stuff watch them sleep calm down i felt supported uh supported and safe and suddenly fuck my life turned upside down here i am a cockroach on my back kicking and screaming with no support we you know i mean her and i really liked each other still really like each other and the thing about this shit is that i cant stand up straight again call her and say lets fight because maybe ive lost the will to fight my arms cant move my voice cant speak the tendons in my neck cant hold my head up and fuck it thats all i want i think we both have failed because we dont know how to forgive because we dont know how to be completely accepted and in the meantime in hurting and being hurt our love its better to say it this way our love resists and grows without any breath to this day extinguishing it its as if i could only love her far away from her with so much desire catano to love her up close body to body as our struggle has been since we met to give her what i havent been able to give her until today and there is within me frozen though it is but always breathing a hidden seed that waits what from the beginning i wanted to give you i want to give you tenderness you see without selfishness the daily routine without routine the absolute surrender of a life in sharing total warm and simple like a chick in the hand a small animal scared and trembling ours he fell silent his throat tight as the gentleman from the selections after folding a corner of the page before closing the magazine poured the contents of a sugar packet in cautious sips into the jaundiced lemon tea the obese lady had definitely overcome the ice cream and nodded lightly feeling like a boa constrictor three short sighted teenagers were conferring over their respective steaks looking askance at a solitary redhead with a knife poised in the air like a storks suspended leg lost in indecipherable meditations none of you can find a person like the other said the friend pushing the empty plate away with the back of his hand none of you can find a person as much for the other as the other as much in agreement with the other as the other but you punish yourself and punish yourself with the guilt of an alcoholic you got stuck in the idiocy of estoril you disappeared no one sees you you evaporated into thin air im still waiting for you so we can finish the work on actingout im out of ideas said the doctor you are empty of everything replied the friend why dont you put your horns against a wall now the psychiatrist remembered something his wife had said shortly before they parted they were sitting on the red sofa in the living room under an engraving of bartholomew that he greatly appreciated while the cat sought a warm space between their hips and at this point she had turned her large resolute brown eyes towards him and declared i dont accept that with or without me you give up because i believe in you and i bet on you wholeheartedly and he remembered how it had stung and hurt him and how he had chased the beast away to embrace the womans narrow dark body repeating gts gts gts in anguished emotion she had been the first person to love him entirely with the enormous weight of his defects inside and the first and the only person to encourage him to write whatever the price for that seemingly pointless torture of putting a poem or a story on a square of paper and i he asked himself what have i really done for you in what have i really tried to help you by opposing my selfishness to your love my disinterest to your interest my surrender to your fight im a shithead asking for help he said to his friend so shitheaded that i cant even hold my pens once again asking for attention from others without giving anything in return i cry tears like a crocodile kid that dont even help me and maybe its only me i think about try being a man for a change replied the friend harpooning his brother marx by the sleeve to ask him for a double coffee try being a man for a change a little bit maybe you can hold on to the swing the doctor looked down and noticed that he hadnt touched his hamburger the sight of the cold curdled meat and sauce caused him to feel a kind of agonized dizziness that swirled from his guts to his mouth he got off the stool as if from a suddenly overly mobile difficult saddle holding back his vomit with the help of his stomach muscles his hands open in front of his mouth in a daze he managed to reach the washbasin and bending forward began to jerkily expel in the sink closest to the door the confused remains of the previous nights dinner and the mornings breakfast whitish gelatinous pieces that slid repulsively down the drain when he managed to control himself enough to wash his mouth and palms he saw in the mirror that his friend behind him was looking at him with his face hollowed out with pallor still twisted by suffocation and cramps hey man he said to the reflected image the guardian angel of his anguish motionless against a background of tiles hey man your cousins cunt a snotty old womans ass father inácios balls it really sucks to be a man isnt it the clouds that formed like a sleeping cap over the cardboard silhouette of the penitentiary extended the dark shadow halfway across the park as the doctor headed for the car that he had usually left parked—he couldnt remember exactly where—somewhere under the golden green of the plane trees that bordered the enormous central space that opened up to the river in a vastness without majesty a group of gypsies squatted on the sidewalk and were shouting over the ownership of a decrepit wall clock whose agonized pendulum swayed like an arm fallen from a stretcher occasionally letting out an exhausted ticking of its last breath it was not yet time for homosexuals to populate the spaces between the trees with their expectant silhouettes caressed by cars that brushed languidly against them like large greedy cats driven by gentlemen who were aging like violets withering in a hurt sweetness the psychiatrist had had his first encounter there with a prostitute who occupied eight meters of limestone with great strides majestic in fake pearls and terrifying glass rings an enormous baker from aljubarrota who had saved him with blows of a handbag from the siren smiles of a pair of transvestites squeezed into red satins with army boots on their feet sergeants rounding the precinct with carnival partygoers in order to drag him authoritatively to a windowless room with engravings of drunken friars on the walls and a portrait of cary grant on the crochet oval of the dresser torn between shyness and desire the doctor had watched in socks hugging the clothes he didnt know where to put the metamorphosis of that cheap mata hari into a being like the monster with herculean breasts tearing up telephone directories in the circus that toured the beach in the summer the mangy tigers of his misery of dull sequins the woman had slipped into the sheets like a slice of ham between two halves of bread and he astonished had come closer until he fearfully touched the bedspread like someone who feels the temperature of the swimming pool with their bunions in a chilly ballet attitude the tulip on the ceiling revealed the planisphere of unknown continents that the humidity had drawn on the limestone the impatient cry is it for today my dear threw him onto the bed with the unanswered vehemence of a welltimed kick and the psychiatrist lost his virginity by penetrating all of him into a large hairy tunnel burying his nose in the pillow strewn with hairpins like a christmas tree of cotton flakes to which patches of dandruff stuck identical to large sheets of fat two days later dripping a burning stearin into his underwear he obtained through the pharmacists injections the certainty that love is a dangerous disease that can be cured with a box of ampoules and warm permanganate washes in the maids bidet to steal the vehemence of passions from his mothers questioning curiosity but at that innocent hour of the afternoon the park was populated only by young japanese people greeting each other in the language of parakeets to whom the gypsies tried to force the wall clock with the determination of someone shoveling cornstarch down the throats of stubborn children and the japanese surprised stared at that strange warehouse of minutes whose pendulum hung from a small glass door like the thornencircled heart of the christs on the prayer cards as if they were observing between curiosity and astonishment an ancestor with features vaguely similar to those of the chrome ufos that flashed luminous messages on their narrow wrists the psychiatrist suddenly felt prehistoric next to these beings whose slanted eyes were leica lenses and whose stomachs had been replaced by datsun carburetors forever free from the twists and turns of heartburn and gases that hesitated between a sigh and a belch i dont know if it was borborygmus or sadness he often thought when his chest swelled and the balloon of a piece of chewing gum without a gum reached his mouth evaporating through his lips in a little whistle like a comet and he attributed to comfort to the esophagus what in fact concerned the confusion of his anguish he found the car cramped by two enormous station wagons ivory elephants used to support greataunt books reluctantly holding a ridiculous pamphlet one of these days ill buy a sixteenwheeled truck and become a decisive person the doctor decided getting into the tiny car its dashboard cluttered with unplayed cassettes and medicine packets that had long since passed their expiry date he kept these useless items like others keep the bottle of stones from gallbladder surgery in a drawer in the moving hope of marking the past of what life leaves behind on the margins of its course and from time to time he ran his fingers over the medicines like arabs caress their mysterious beads i am a man of a certain age he said aloud as he always did when lisbon in a meditative gesture like a farmed lobster tightened its pincers around the tendons of his neck and houses trees squares and streets entered tumultuously into his head in the style of a painting by soutine dancing a carnivorous and frenetic charleston turning the steering wheel from side to side like a rudder he avoided the sleeping hippos in the stations raising their lazy eyes from the asphalt river in the headlights mammals manned by loquacious traveling salesmen who traveled the province on safaris in which the indigenous villages gave way to bandstands afflicted with rust psoriasis around which old men with walking sticks spat authoritatively into their sheepskin boots and he entered the sobbing ant trail of traffic controlled from the back by the unsensual winks of the traffic light the luminous green resembled the color of the irises of the eldest daughter when she smiled with pleasure under her disheveled blond hair a tiny witch astride the wooden zebra broom of the merrygoround during trips of exultant joy the psychiatrist then thought she was much older than she really was and he felt leaning against the iron balustrade paying the waiter melancholically an elderly gentleman stumbling in his drawers towards the near goal of prostate cancer and the last catheter poor final pinwheels of anonymous destinies with the car engine stuttering to the indigestionlike jerks of a long row of bonnets i would look for the dentists office in the baroque valmor prizes on the street corners the small jeronimos that hid inside dynasties of retired colonels and amazing octogenarians he didnt work on friday afternoons and did his best to furnish the long hollow tunnel of the weekends with small marginal activities just as his aunts occupied the comfortable space in the mornings armed with rosaries kind words and fivetoston coins visiting what they proudly called "our poor little people" accommodating creatures who had not yet been assailed by the disturbing bogeyman of communism with dangerous doubts about the virtue of the saint the doctor had accompanied them on a few occasions on these sinister raids dont get too close to them because of the illnesses and he had a poignant memory of the smell of hunger and misery and of a paralytic crawling in the mud between the huts his hand outstretched to his aunts who assured him with a missal in hand of the splendors of eternity on the essential condition that he scrupulously respected our familys silver on the way home the psychiatrist was in turn catechized the boy prays that there wont be a revolution because these people are quite capable of killing us all while they explained to him that god being a conservative par excellence ensured the balance of institutions by offering those who had not created galloping tuberculosis that spared them the daily drudgery of housework and the hot flashes of menopause scarlet waves that reminded them of the shameful fact of having under their skirts the demands present even if dying of a sex and it occurred to him that when he had started to masturbate his mother intrigued had gone to show her husband a stain on her underwear following which she had received a formal summons to appear at the office the main altar of the house where his father endlessly studied strange diseases in german books with a pipe in his gums being called to the office was in itself the most solemn and terrible act of his childhood and he entered the august place with his hands behind his back and his tongue already curled in apologies with the resignation of a calf in the slaughterhouse his father who was writing on a board on his knees slid a severe sideways glance towards him like a black dress where the lace of the underskirt could be glimpsed a kind of furtive understanding and said in the beautiful deep voice with which he recited anteros sonnets during his childrens anginas sitting on the edge of the bed book in hand solemnly as if he were performing an initiatory ritual be careful and wash yourself and it was the first time the doctor thought that he had been physically aware of that his father had been young and had confronted himself looking at his thin serious face carved with bones and the sharp eye sockets of a phosphorescent brown with the distressing evidence of having to stumble in turn from metamorphosis to metamorphosis towards the perfect insect that he would never reach i wont be able to i wont be able to i wont be able to he repeated himself standing on the office carpet staring at his fathers quaker silhouette bent over the paper with the attention of an embroiderer the future appeared to him in the form of a dark greedy drain ready to suck his body through its rusty throat a path of a tumble from sewer to sewer towards the intractable sea of old age leaving on the sand of the ebb tide the teeth and hair of majestic decrepitudes the mothers portrait smiled on the shelf with melancholic glows of a rose window as if the morning of her joy was barely making it through the pale stained glass of her lips she too had not managed to do so wavering indecisively between the basket and eca and losing herself alone in a corner of the sofa in enigmatic meditations and perhaps the same had happened to the others the rest of the tribe solitary even when not alone irremediably separated by the infinity of despair he saw his grandfather again on the veranda of the house in nelas on those afternoons in beira when the twilight stretches over the mountains like lilac mists from a biblical film observing the chestnut trees with the bitterness of an admiral on top of a sinking ship he saw his grandmother pacing back and forth in the hallway the fever of useless energy in which the flame burned his uncles who had been plasticized by everyday life the lukewarm resignation of the visits the silence that suddenly covered the hum of conversations and during which people were agitated terrified prey to fears that could not be expressed who was capable the psychiatrist asked himself looking for a place for his car near the dentists office and parking it in the back next to a leprous grocery store murdered in its rice and potatoes by a gigantic supermarket that offered astonished visitors already chewed american food wrapped in the cellophane of andy williams voice evaporating in seductive breaths from wisely distributed speakers who was capable of offering himself the perfect profile of a romanian gymnast motionless in the air in a rings exercise releasing puffs of talcum powder from tarzans armpits maybe im dead he thought im certainly dead so nothing important can happen to me anymore just gangrene eating away at my body from the inside my head empty of ideas and up above on the surface the soft hand of the wind stirring searching the tops of the cypresses in a tremor of old newspaper pages that are crumpled in the corridor of the dentists office the buzzing of the drill hovered invisibly in the shadows insistently like a blowtorch searching for the lump of sugar in an unsuspecting molar the employee thin and pale like a hemophiliac countess extended her transparent fingers to him from across the counter are you feeling better doctor he belonged to the class of portuguese people who transform life events in a chilling succession of diminutives the previous week the doctor had listened crushed to the detailed account of the flu of the employees son a perverse child who used to entertain himself with the pbx pegs diverting the howls of pain from lisbon abscesses to boston or nepal he had a little pain in his tummy i put the thermometer in his arm the poor boys eyes were so inflamed that i cant even imagine he spent a week eating chicken soup i even thought about calling the doctors father you never know at that age if the little brain is affected now thank god hes recovered i promised a candle to saint philomena i left him sitting in his bed quiet playing receptionist since he cant answer here he pretends to answer there just now the engineer godinho that strong man very nice and not offending who spoke because his wisdom tooth was bothering him was surprised not to hear my little edgar he was used to him he even said to me oh dona delmira so the boy god willing next week the engineer will have him here i said its not because hes my son that would even look bad on me but the doctor doesnt calculate the way he has with the headphones in crescendo he certainly enters marconi my sister always repeats ive never seen him like edgar filipe she calls him edgar filipe which is his name edgar from his father and filipe from his godfather ive never seen him like edgar filipe for the pbx and its true my sister is married to an electrician and these things dont escape her may our lady grant that the flu doesnt reach her little ears i dont even want to think about it im getting dizzy right away ive been struggling you see the doctor from the caixa warned me madam be careful with the pressure theres nothing wrong with your kidneys but be careful with the pressure so the doctors appointment is scheduled for friday this kind of filigree caravel talk thought the psychiatrist provokes in me the same admiring exaltation that crochet doilies and carousel paintings awaken in me amulets of people dying in a landscape made up of cats on groundfloor windowsills and underground urinals the river itself comes to sigh in the depths of the toilets with its unimportant asthma after rounding cape bojador the sea has become irremediably fat and tame like the dogs at the gates rubbing against our ankles with the irritating submission of the backs of castrated animals fearing a new description of health problems the doctor disappeared into the cave in the waiting room like a crab threatened by a tenacious shrimp fish there a pile of missionary magazines piled up next to the wroughtiron lamp that spread a filtered light from a squinting eye socket guaranteed him the innocent peace of a zulu lords prayer arranging his hips on the black leather sofa worn by the countless cavities that had preceded it a stuffed horse shaped like a chair and perhaps capable of three or four stumbling kicks he extracted from the pile of virtuous newspapers the remains of a weekly with a laughing half caste nun on the cover and in which a scottish priest narrated in a long article illustrated by photographs of zebras the fruitful evangelization of a tribe of pygmies two of whom deacon mfulum and subdeacon tloclu were preparing today in rome the revolutionary thesis that established the exact height of noahs ark from the calculation of the average length of giraffes necks ethnotheology overturned the catechism soon a canon from saudi arabia would demonstrate that adam was a camel the serpent a pipeline and god the father a sheikh with rayban sunglasses commanding schools of angels and eunuchs from paradise from his sixdoor mercedes for a moment the psychiatrist thought that the aga khan was in fact the incarnation of jesus christ avenging himself for the troubles of calvary by skiing down the swiss mountains in the company of miss philippines and that the true saints were the tanned men who advertised packs of rothmans king size in virile attitudes of triumphal postcoitus he compared himself to them in his mind and the memory of the figure he glimpsed from time to time by surprise in the mirrors of the pastry shops thin fragile and possessing a kind of unfinished grace made him confront himself for the millionth time with the bitterness of his earthly origin promised a future without glory a constant pain twisted his jaw he felt alone and helpless in the face of a senseless chess game whose rules he did not know he urgently needed a nursery teacher to teach him how to walk bending over to him the generous and ardent breasts of a roman she wolf contained by the softtouch fabric of a pink bra no one was waiting for him anywhere no one cared particularly about him and the leather sofa became his raft as a castaway adrift through the deserted city this dizzying certainty of emptiness that visited him more frequently in the morning hours when he would painfully regroup around himself in the pasty and greasy movements of an explorer returning from stellar journeys to find himself sluggish in two meters of disheveled sheets dissolved a little when he heard footsteps approaching in the corridor of the office greeted by the voice of the hemophiliac good afternoon miss edite you have to wait a little in the room leaving the cubicle in the murmur of tearful prayer of someone reciting the koran from a crack in a mosque raising the chin of the pygmies illuminated by the exemplary spiritual journey of saint aloysius gonzaga he came across a redhaired girl who had come to sit in the twin chair of his on the opposite side of the lamp and who after a first appraising glance brief and attentive like the tongue of a spotlight rested her clear eyes on him in the wave of eyelashes with which the turtledoves nestle in the elbows of the statues in the building opposite a very fat woman was shaking out a rug among geraniums while the upstairs neighbor in an undershirt was reading the sports newspaper on a canvas bench on the balcony it was a quarter past two in the afternoon the red haired girl took a book from the vampire collection marked with a subway ticket from her purse crossed her legs like the blades of scissors overlapping each other and the curve of her instep hers resembled that of degass ballerinas suspended in gestures that were at once instantaneous and eternal enveloped in the cotton vapor of the painters tenderness there are always those who are ecstatic when people fly hello said the doctor in the tone in which picasso must have addressed his dove the redhaired girls eyebrows converged until they formed the circumflex accent of the roof of a kiosk that the plane tree branches of her loose locks lightly touched “that was the time when toothaches talked” she said she had the kind of timbre you imagine marlene dietrich would have had in her youth none of my teeth hurt because i wear false teeth the doctor said im just replacing them with shark fins so i can swallow the fish in my godmothers aquarium better im here to murder the dentist declared the redhaired girl i just learned the recipe from perry mason when you were in high school you could certainly solve quadratic equations in a jiffy thought the psychiatrist who was frightened by pragmatic women your domain had always been that of confused and wandering dreams with no table of logarithms to decode them and you could barely come to terms with the idea of a geometric ordering of life within which you felt disoriented like an ant without a compass hence your feeling of existing only in the past and of the days slipping backwards like old clocks whose hands move backwards in search of the dead in the portraits slowly illuminated by the resurrection of the hours your grandparents from brazil stuck their yellow beards out of the album balloon skirts puffed up in the drawers of photographs distant cousins in leggings chatted in the living room mr barros e castro recited gomes leal in a beautiful intonation how old am i he asked himself periodically checking himself which gave him a precarious understanding of external reality a viscous substance in which his steps sank perplexed aimless his daughters his identity card and his place in the hospital still anchored him to everyday life but by such fine threads he continued to hover a furry little seed from breath to breath hesitating since he had separated from his wife he had lost ground and meaning his trousers were loose around his waist his collars were missing buttons he was gradually beginning to resemble an asocial bum in whose carefully trimmed beard one could detect the ashes of a decent past lately looking at himself in the mirror he felt that his own features were becoming uninhabited the folds of his smile giving way to wrinkles of discouragement his face was becoming more and more foreheadlike soon he would part his ear and cross his bald head with six or seven sticky strands of hairspray in a ridiculous illusion of youth he suddenly remembered his mothers wistful sigh my children are so beautiful even at thirty and desperately wanting to return to the starting line where promises of victory are not only permitted but necessarily desirable the field of projects that never come to fruition was never a little like his homeland his neighborhood the house of which he knew by heart every nook and cranny the rickety chairs the insects the intimate smells the creaking boards “do you want to have dinner with me tonight” he asked the redhaired girl who was perfecting her criminal intentions through perry masons mediocre deductions lining up syllogisms of implacable stupidity in court the hemophiliac called him from the hallway she hurriedly wrote down the telephone number on a piece of paper torn from the page of the missionary magazine where a group of cannibal sacristans were taking communion under guise with evident appetite at seven at seventhirty does the hairdresser arrive at seven thirty and headed for the dentists office imagining red thighs spread out on the sheets in the happy abandonment of after love the freckled pubis the smell of skin she sat down on the torture chair surrounded by dark instruments drills hooks stilettos irons a gum on a plate given over to the exciting task of imagining her apartment cushions on the floor books from the readers circle on the shelves trinkets of women only recovering their innocence through stuffed animals photographs celebrating dead idylls a friend with glasses and a bad complexion discussing the left amidst the antibourgeois fumes of tres vintes in his fits of misogyny the doctor used to classify women according to the tobacco they smoked the noncontraband marlboro type read gore vidal spent the summer in ibiza found giscard destaing and prince philippe very dull and intelligence a strange nuisance; the contraband marlboro type was interested in design bridge and agatha christie in english frequented the muxaxo swimming pool and considered culture a vaguely amusing phenomenon when accompanied by a love of golf; the sggigante type enjoyed jean ferrat truffaut and the nouvel observateur voted socialist and maintained relationships with men that were both emancipated and iconoclastic; the sgfilter class had a che guevara poster on their bedroom wall fed spiritually on reich and interior design magazines couldnt sleep without pills and camped out on the weekends at the albufeira lagoon conspiring to create a marxist studies centre; the portuguesesoft style didnt paint themselves cut their nails short studied anti psychiatry and agonised over oblique passions for ugly protest singers with unbuttoned nazare shirts and peremptory and schematic social notions; finally the lumpen with the tobacco in their shrouds languished to the sound of pink floyd on batterypowered record players next to their friends suzuki teenagers advertising koni shock absorbers on the backs of their plastic jackets on the fringes of this simplified taxonomy was the boquilha group menopausal women who owned boutiques antique shops and restaurants in alfama and jingled with bracelets moroccan women straight from the efforts of beauty salons into the arms of men who were too young or too old who tended to their melancholy and demands in duplexes in campo de ourique flooded with the voice of ferre and rosa ramalhos dolls and where indirect lamps tinged their worn breasts with a modest and favorable shadow you he thought referring to the woman while the dentist a sort of sarcastic mephistopheles shone a tremendous light from a boxing ring into her eyes you he thought have always escaped the derision and irony with which i try to hide the tenderness that i am ashamed of and the affection that terrifies me perhaps because from the beginning you realized that beneath the challenge the aggressiveness the arrogance there was hidden a distressed plea a blind mans cry the piercing gaze of a deaf person who does not understand and tries in vain to decipher on the lips of others the soothing words he needs you always came without me calling you you always supported my suffering and my fear we grew up side by side learning from each other the communion of shared isolation like when i left in the rain for angola and your dry eyes said goodbye without speaking dark stones holding inside as if a juice of love and he remembered his body lying in bed on the afternoons in marimba under the enormous mango trees teeming with bats that waited for the night hanging by their feet like carnivorous umbrellas rat angels a friend called them and his eldest daughter who was just starting to walk stumbling toward them clinging to the walls we cant handle many challenges the psychiatrist thought at the moment the dentist hooked the vacuum cleaner to the corner of his mouth we cant handle many challenges and we almost always end up running away in terror at the first difficulty that appears defeated without a fight like skinny dogs that prowl the back of hotels at a slow trot hungry for food the sound of the drill approaching with the ferocity of a wasp woke him to the reality of the imminent pain when that tiny black and decker touched his jaw the doctor held the arms of the chair with both hands tightened his stomach muscles closed his eyelids tightly and just as he used to do when faced with suffering anguish and insomnia he began to imagine the sea the streets outside continued with one walk in the sun and another in the shade like cripples in mismatched shoes and the doctor lingered at the door of the office feeling his aching jaws to make sure he continued to exist from the eyes down ever since he had seen in africa the orbits of crocodiles drifting in the river searching for the bodies they had lost he had been afraid of letting go of himself to float without the weight of intestines around the blind people who play out of tune on street corners with their rheumatic accordions of chopins from the pasodoble this city that was his always offered him through its avenues and squares the infinitely variable face of a capricious lover that the trees darkened with the cone of shadow of melancholic remorse and he would stumble upon the neptunes of the lakes like a drunkard finds himself coming out of a street lamp with the fierce chin of a humorless policeman culturally fed by the grammatical errors of the corporal of the police station all the statues pointed their fingers towards the sea inviting him to india or to a discreet suicide depending on the state of mind and the level of desire for adventure in the childhood depot the psychiatrist observed the tugboatsfreighters pushing enormous oiltankers and he delegated to them the effort of body and spirit that he had given up making sitting inside himself like the old eskimos abandoned on the ice emptied of feelings by the northern agony that inhabits them upon returning from the war the doctor meanwhile accustomed to the forest the sunflower farms and the blacks patient and eternal notion of time in which the minutes suddenly elastic could last for entire weeks of peaceful expectation had had to make a painful effort to adapt himself to the tiled buildings that made up his native huts the paleness of their faces forced him to diagnose a collective anemia and the accentless portuguese seemed as devoid of charm as the daily routine of a clerk men cramped in cilices and ties agitated around him in bitter quarrels the god zumbi lord of destiny and rain had not crossed the equator seduced by a continent where even death possessed the impetuous joy of a triumphant birth between the angola he had lost and the lisbon he had not regained the doctor felt doubly orphaned and this state of being left alone had continued painfully because so much had changed in his absence the streets were turning into unexpected elbows the television antennas were scaring the pigeons towards the river forcing them to do a seagulls fado unexpected wrinkles gave his aunts mouths the expressions of disillusioned montaignes the multiplication of family events was pushing him back into the prehistory of the serial of which he only knew the paleolithic accidents cousins he had abandoned in their shorts were muttering into their incipient beards a revolt that transcended himthey celebrated the dead who had been left to collect treasury bonds to which they had transferred their childish appetite for accumulating bottle caps in essence it was as if through him a fr luís de sousa in a blazer was being repeated so in his free afternoons he would ride his small battered car and methodically check out the city neighborhood by neighborhood and church by church on pilgrimages that invariably ended at the rocha do conde de obidos which he had left one day for the imposed adventure and with whom he maintained despite everything the respectful and masochistic intimacy that victims reserve for retired executioners the dentists office was located in an area of lisbon as uncharacteristic as a hepatitis diet where flower sellers would leave baskets of their dying spring flowers on the sidewalk spreading an atmosphere of wakefulness in the air reminding him of the night he had gone to dinner near são jorge castle in a french restaurant where the price of the dishes meant he had to take heartburn tablets that the tenderness of the filet mignon spared him they were the popular saints and the city dressed up in a kind of mysticalprofane carnival identical to a naked woman sparkling with glass jewels the breath of marches bubbled in the gutters funereal notaries invaded alfama with draculalike gestures the square in front of the restaurant suspended over the river like a zeppelin of low houses twisted with cramps like in cezannes paintings was populated by trees concentrating within themselves an immense quantity of darkness shadows that the wind rustled like change in a pocket coins made of branches and leaves pregnant with sleeping birds thin englishmen like exclamation marks without vehemence disembarked from taxis whose engines purred like the calls of disgruntled trawlers between the meshes of noise one could sense the concave texture of silence the same silence that threateningly inhabited the fear of darkness inherited from childhood panics and the psychiatrist intrigued searched for its origin from window to window until he found on the ground floor a wideopen door to an empty room without engravings or curtains furnished only by a coffin covered in black cloth resting on two benches and by a middleaged woman with tears still on her cheeks a creature from battleship potemkin a tragic statue of grief maybe this is life thought the doctor jumping over a basket of chrysanthemums to reach the car drowned in corollas like the corpse of a commander a dead man in the center and saint anthony around him the core of sadness surrounded by the jovial pulp of grilled sardines and fireworks and he thought that the toothache was awakening in him the pitiful images of modas & bordados that constituted the true depths of his soul when he was distressed bad taste faith in the lord of the steps and the desire to be marsupialized in some lap reappeared intact genuine materials that persisted under the varnish of disdain he started the engine to escape from his island of honeyed petals from which he jumped like a dolphin from a lake in a hiccup of connecting rods and went down to martim moniz spreading stems identical to botticellis venus redesigned by cesário verde the sentimento dum ocidental was a bit like his underwear alexandrines drawers never naked even for the ardent minutes of a furtive relationship almirante reis avenue eternally grey rainy and sad in the july sun alternately marked by street vendors and invalids trotted towards the tagus between two rows of decayed buildings like a gentleman squeezed into new shoes for the tram stop alert industrialists placed smuggled clocks on the terraces to which the shoe shiners squatting on wooden chamber pots gave the unusual dimension of a nursery in gigantic cafes like empty swimming pools lonely unemployed people awaited the last judgement in front of immemorial gallons and tertiary toasts frozen in waiting attitudes hairdressing salons inhabited by cockroaches offered housewives with their hair in short supply unexpected solutions to which dusty haberdashery would give the finishing touch of lace bras mosquito nets capable of rejuvenating twentyfive years of conjugal resignation with formidable erections the psychiatrist liked the small crossroads that fed that majestic and slow river of additional hairdressers and suburban shoe shops pushing a provincial universe towards the baixa pieces of povoa de santo adrião drifting through lisbon unexpected beer halls carpeted with lupins he breathed better away from the big stores from the competent shop assistants better dressed than he was from the regicides on horseback gesticulating bronzed impetus as a child he would spend long hours at the coal mine next to his parents house where a dirtyfaced titan would make briquettes and threaten his wife with monstrous beatings and at lunch he would pick up his fork to listen to the dull echo of these energetic loves if he could choose he would undoubtedly barricade himself with comfortable quinane tables and plastic vases of roses and if he were ill he would demand that the hospital oxygen be scented with garlic in praca da figueira where the nearby existence of seagulls is beginning to be suspected by the restlessness of the sparrows in the same way that the shadow of a smile announces an imminent reconciliation his molar had completely stopped hurting tamed by the dentists maneuvers who had reduced it to the mediocrity of anonymity in that professional with the drill there was something of a school prefect ready to soften the whims of the originals with a beating d joão iv a problematic hero stared with hollow eyes at a row of balconies representative offices representing mold cold tobacco and humidity one could guess at the non functioning toilets behind every wall commercial invalids in every hirsute adolescent desperate menopauses in the policewomen the doctor reached rua do ouro aseptic of money changers as straight as the intentions of a virtuous canon and headed for the parking lot by the river where he had always spent his solitude because he belonged to the class of people who only know how to suffer beyond their means there on a slatted bench he had read marcus aurelius and epictetus for afternoons on end to conjure up a distant lost love the waves curled around his feet in a canine fraternity and it was as if he could wash away the injustices of the world from his ankles onwards he parked his car next to a germanregistered trailer in whose dirt one could decipher the thrills of adventure tempered by the domestic modesty of the polkadot curtains and rolled down the window to smell the muddy water where men and women buried up to their knees were filling rusty tins with bait the reapers of the low tide he said to himself were herons created by fascism wading birds of hunger and misery sophia andresens verses came to mind in a rumbling of battletorn veins these people whose faces are sometimes luminous and other times rough now it reminds me of slaves now it reminds me of kings it revives my taste for fighting and combat against the serpent and the snake the pig and the kite the traffic lurched along behind him pushed by the imperious sleeves of the traffic men perched on circus pedestals tamers with the aerial gestures of dancers bird shops fluttered between food shops and drugstores with bunches of brooms hanging from the ceiling like hairy fruits and some attic windows also rose vertically into the sky blown by the feathers of the clothes drying from balcony to balcony the wings of shirts fading against the cheeks of the facades the massive building of the arsenal was green with sea moss nostalgic for impossible shipwrecks further away a cemetery spread the white cloth of tombs like baby teeth over a line of trees and church spires four in the afternoon swelled on the municipal clocks whose chimes could be said to be contemporary with fernão lopes calm as dead tragedies the trains from cais do sodre were dragging the first players and the last tourists to estoril norwegians with index fingers lost on the city map and the streets and the river were beginning to converge in the same horizontal summer peace that the factories of barreiro colored with workerred smoke anticipating the sunset a cargo boat was sailing up the riverbank chased by a crown of voracious seagulls and the psychiatrist thought about how his daughters would appreciate being there with him at that moment agitated in a shower of ecstatic questions the desire to see them gradually mingled with the bodies of the harvesters on the bank who called out to each other in shouts close to him distorted or muffled by the refraction of the air reduced to flickering echoes that the wind shaped like veils of sounds with the weight of lisbon stuck to their backs like a hump of buildings and the stray dogs sniffing in vain in the surroundings for the urine message of the ideal pekingese their tiny faces bore the painful outline of their remorse which on weekends they tried in vain to bribe with excessive permissibility and viscous tenderness a lavish magician king with chocolates that were not demanded of him knowing that at night he would not be with them to kiss them goodbye already heavy with the lassitude of sleep that he would not tiptoe away their nightmares by whispering in their ears the words of love from the secret vocabulary common to donald duck and snow white that in the morning his absence from the couples bed had become an accepted habit without surprise made him guilty of the dreadful crime of abandoning them all he could do during the week was keep an eye on them secretly like a spy be the jose matias of two irretrievably lost elisas who followed paths divergent from his own tiny fragments of his blood that he followed torn apart from an ever greater distance his desertion must have disappointed and confused them as they were still waiting for his return his footsteps on the stairs his open arms his former laughter his fathers sentence spiraled through his head the only thing i feel sorry for is your daughters charged with the restrained emotion with which one could guess in him the modesty of affection that he had only learned to know and admire after adolescence and he found himself as base and malignant as a sick animal reduced to the asphyxiating proportions of a present without a future he had turned life into a straitjacket in which it was impossible for him to move tied by the straps of self disgust and the isolation that impregnated him with a bitter sadness without mornings a clock somewhere struck half past four if he drove fast enough he would be in time for school to leave a liberating act par excellence a victory of laughter over tired stupidity something in him coming from the most remote part of his memory insisted on assuring him contrary to the terrible official weight of the multiplication tables that there is a blackboard somewhere who knows if in the attic of the attic or in the basement of the basement stating that two and two do not make four hidden by the ice cream freezer purring like a polar bear against the window of a pastry shop the psychiatrist hunched over peered at the school gate in the attitude of a red man waiting behind his rock for the arrival of the white scouts he had left his faithful black horse three or four hundred metres above near the benfica woods and its obese turtledoves falcons recycled by the need for urban survival that forces the great manitou to disguise himself as the lord of the steps and had come crawling from plane tree to plane tree watched with astonishment by the street vendors selling purses and shoelaces warrior brothers whose warlike activity was limited to stumbling away from the approach of the police pushing trays of scalps of useless trinkets ahead of them now under the shelter of the chocolate hellos scanning the horizon of the street with the pupils of a myopic eagle the doctor released into the prairie air the smoke signals of a nervous cigarette that translated syllable by syllable the extent of his anxiety in the building opposite the one where he was hiding there lived among cats and dedicated photographs of bishops in vogue an elderly aunt sheltered by her oneeyed maid venerable squaws of the family tribe visited at christmas by excursions of incredulous relatives surprised by their combative longevity secretly the psychiatrist could not forgive them for outliving the grandmother he had loved so much and whose memory still touched him when he felt at his lowest ebb he would go to her house enter the living room and shamelessly inform her i come here to be petted and he would rest his head on her lap so that her fingers touching the back of his neck would soothe his unfounded rage and his eager desire for tenderness since the age of sixteen the only important changes he had noticed were the deaths of the three or four people who had felt constant affection for him resistant to the twists and turns of his whims his selfishness measured the pulse of the world according to the attention he received he had only woken up to others too late when most of them had turned their backs on him bored by the stupidity of his arrogance and the disdainful sarcasm in which his shyness and fear crystallized devoid of generosity tolerance and gentleness he only cared about being cared about making himself the sole theme of a monotonous symphony he would even ask his friends how they managed to exist far from his egocentric orbit that the novels and poems he wrote without writing them formed a kind of narcissistic extension with no connection to life a hollow architecture of words a design of sentences emptied of emotion an ecstatic spectator of his own suffering he planned to reformulate the past when he was incapable of fighting for the present cowardly and vain he avoided looking himself in the eye understanding his reality as a useless corpse and beginning the anguished learning of being alive curls of mothers his own age a fact that continued to surprise him he had difficulty recognizing that he was getting older began to gather at the school gates like hens and the doctor thought about going up to his elderly aunts floor where entrenched behind the portrait of the cardinal patriarch who looked like a rich clown he would be able to watch the classes leave from an easy snipers angle shooting longing through the double barrels of his dark circles but the blind eye of the maid who would relentlessly pursue him from cat to cat and from bishop to bishop probing his interior in the milky light of the waterfalls forced him to give up his oswald project he knew he was too fragile to endure a silent interrogation balanced by the displays of joy from the old women who would certainly insist on repeating to him for the millionth time the tormenting story of his birth a purple child suffocating with secretions next to his mother with eclampsia resigned to the bakery trench whose coffee machine whinnied steam through the impatient nostrils of an aluminum thoroughbred he rested his elbows on the electric iceberg of the glacier like an eskimo hugging his igloo and continued to wait next to a legless beggar lying on a blanket who stretched out two fingers at the height of the others knees just like in africa he thought exactly like in africa awaiting the miraculous arrival of dusk in marimbas jango while the clouds darkened cambo and baixa do cassanj and filled with the echo of thunder the arrival of dusk and the arrival of the mail that the column brought your long damp love letters you sick in luanda the girl far from both of you and the soldier who committed suicide in mangando lay down in the ward put his gun to his chin said good night and there were pieces of teeth and bone embedded in the zinc of the ceiling stains of blood flesh cartilage the lower half of his face transformed into a horrible hole he agonized for four hours in froglike jerks stretched out on the infirmary table the corporal holding the petromax that cast large confused shadows on the walls the barking of the goats in the darkness skeletal dogs with bat ears dawns of unknown stars the chief of dala and his sick twins the people waiting for their appointment on the steps of the post shivering with malaria paths destroyed by the violence of the rain one time we were sitting after lunch near the wire on that kind of tombstone with the battalions shields painted on it and suddenly a flashy american car covered in dust appeared on the chiquita road with a bald man inside a lone civilian neither a pide nor an administrator nor a hunter nor a member of the leprosy brigade but a photographer a photographer equipped with those tripod cameras from beaches and fairs implausible in their archaic nature offering to take pictures of everyone present alone or in groups to send to their families by letter memories of the war faded smiles of exile there was no baby food in malanj and our daughter returned to portugal thin and pale with the yellowish color of angolan whites rusty with fever a year sleeping on a palmstaff bed next to our barracks beds i was doing an autopsy outdoors because of the smell when they called me because you had fainted i found you exhausted on a chair made of barrel planks i closed the door i squatted down crying next to you repeating until the end of the world until the end of the world until the end of the world certain that nothing could separate us like a wave towards the beach my body goes towards you exclaimed neruda and it was like that with us and it is like that with me only i am not able to tell you or i will tell you if you are not there i tell you alone dizzy with the love i have for you we hurt each other so much we hurt each other we tried to kill each other inside each one and despite this underground and immense the wave continues and as if towards the beach towards you the wheat of my body leans ears of fingers that seek you try to touch you cling to your skin with strength of nails your narrow legs squeeze my waist i go up the stairs i knock on the latch i enter the mattress still knows the shape of my sleep i hang the clothes on the chair like a wave towards the beach like a wave towards the beach like a wave towards the beach my body goes towards you teresa the maid emerged from grão vasco avenue where the mulberry leaves transform the sun into a green aquarium lamp sparkling with sieved reflections so much so that people sometimes give the impression of floating in the light with the edgeless attitudes of fishes and walked past him with her slow sacredcow pace sweetened by her cruel smile if teresa couldnt get me no one can the doctor thought leaning closer to the iceberg until he felt the smooth contact of the enamel on his belly a little extra effort and he would cross the wall of the glacier the cocoon in which human larvae run the risk of metamorphosing into cassata being eaten with a spoon at a family dinner suddenly seemed like a pleasant fate the beggar in the blanket who was counting his profits thought he could guess his intentions if youre going to palm take out the chichas here too vanilla so it doesnt fuck up my ulcer a lady who was leaving the bakery with a package hanging from each finger was terrified by the strange pair of criminals who were plotting a sinister ice cream robbery and ran away towards damaia perhaps fearing that we would threaten her with candy guns the beggar who had an aesthete in him looked with pleasure at the vastness of her thighs firstrate tambourine and autobiographical before the accident i used to go to communion every sunday girls from arco do cego for the price of a grape the sluts are now worse than cod a commotion of children near the school gates announced to the psychiatrist that classes were over the beggar stirred angrily in his blanket those bastards steal more from me than they give me and the doctor pondered whether this irritated phrase might not contain within itself the seeds of a universal truth which led him to look at his partner with new respect rembrandt for example did not end up much more prosperous and he is not exempt from encountering a pascal in the water collector antonio aleixo sold bonds camões wrote letters on the street for those who could not read gomes leal composed alexandrines on the stamped paper of the notary where he worked dozens of nobel prize winners in blue jeans challenge the police at maoist demonstrations in these strange times intelligence seems stupid and stupidity intelligent and it becomes healthy to distrust both as a matter of prudence just as as a boy he was advised to stay away from the overly friendly gentlemen who approach the boys at the school gates with a strange glint in their glasses the sidewalk was filled with students herded by their mothers who chased them home like the turkey sellers in praca da figueira on christmas eve and the doctor thought with melancholy about how difficult it is to educate adults who are so little aware of the vital importance of a stick of chewing gum or a box of plasticine and so concerned with the idiotic trifle of good table manners who love to write obscene messages on the marble of the urinals and detest harmless pencil marks on the living room wall the beggar who would certainly understand these and other musings kept the prescription in his waistcoat pocket safe from the students rapacious claws and pulled out a tuberculosis certificate to persuade the undecided taxpayers in his favor then he saw his daughters in the middle of a group of girls in uniforms wearing checkered skirts the straight blond hair of the eldest the brown curls of the youngest making their way one after the other towards teresa and his intestines suddenly too big for his belly button swelled with the mushrooms of tenderness he wanted to run to them take their hands and the three of them set off like at the end of the grand meaulnes on their way to glorious adventures the future in panavision stretched out before him real and unreal like a fairy tale carpeted with the voice of paul simon we were married on a rainy day the sky was yellow and the grass was gray we signed the papers and we drove away i do it for y our love the rooms were musty and the pipes were old all that winter we shared a cold drank all the orange j uice that we could hold i do it for your love found a rug in an old junk shop and i brought it home to you or along the way the colors ran the orange bled the blue the sting of reason the splash of tears the northern and southern hemispheres love emerges and it disappears i do it for y our love i do it for y our love teresa placed a red and white cap on each of their heads and the psychiatrist noticed that the youngest was carrying her favorite doll a rag creature with eyes drawn randomly on the bald sphere of her face and whose mouth opened in a pathetic froglike grimace they slept together in bed and maintained complex family relationships that must have evolved according to the girls mood and of which i was vaguely aware through occasional mysterious phrases that compelled me to perpetual exercises of imagination the eldest who was characterized by an anguished vision of existence supported with inanimate objects charlots battle against the cogs of life prematurely promised a victorious defeat twisted with love cramps the doctor had the impression that he had taken out a dream insurance policy for them paying the interest in the form of the gases from his colitis and the stalled projects he was languishing over the hope that they would go further than he had animated him with the joy of a pioneer believing that his daughters would perfect papins poor lunchbox of his desires sneezing through the artisanal cracks with smokefilled disappointments teresa said goodbye to a comrade in arms who was holding her own against the class aggression of a boy who seemed to be a manager and walked with the girls towards the avenue an aquarium of buildings trembling in the luminous shade of the trees the sting of reason the splash of tears the northern and southern hemispheres love emerges and it disappears i do it for y our love i do it for y our love bent over like the poet chiado on his bronze bench the doctor could have touched them when they almost brushed past him on their way home their eyes fixed on an iron duck at the entrance to a tobacconists which for twentyfive tostões swayed and shook in an epileptic gallop he coughed with emotion and the beggar sarcastic turned his shaggy skull bathed in a ferocious laugh towards him do they turn you on you little rascal and for the second time that day the psychiatrist felt like vomiting himself for a long time until he was empty of all the shit he had the doctor parked his car in one of the little streets that lead out of the jardim das amoreiras like the legs of an insect whose shell was made of grass and trees and headed for the bar he had two hours to spare before his analysis session and he thought that perhaps he would distract himself by observing others especially the kind of others who look at themselves in the mirror from glasses of whiskey six oclock fish in their aquarium of alcohol whose oxygen is the carbon dioxide from the bubbles in the water of the castle what do people who frequent bars he wondered do in the morning and he thought that as the end of the night approached the drinkers would evaporate into the thin atmosphere of smoke like the genie in aladdins lamp until with the arrival of a new twilight they would regain their flesh smiles and slow gestures like an anemone the tentacles of their arms would stretch out for the first glass the music would start playing again the world would get back on track and large faience birds would take flight from the formica sky of sadness the stone arches above the garden had the exact curve of eyebrows astonished to find themselves there next to the confusion of the anarchic anthill of the mouse and the psychiatrist had the feeling that it was as if a face from many centuries ago were examining surprised and serious the swings and the slide that were between the trees and that no child had ever seen use abandoned like the merrygorounds of a defunct fair he could not explain why but the amoreiras garden always seemed to him to be something lonely and extremely melancholy even in the summer and this had been the case since the distant years when he would go there for an hour a week to receive drawing lessons from a fat man who lived on the second floor full of plastic model airplanes my mothers worries the doctor reflected my mothers eternal worries about me her permanent fear that one day she would see me collecting rags and bottles from the garbage cans with a bag on my back transformed into a factory worker in the misery his mother had little faith in him as a grownup and responsible individual she took everything he did as a kind of game and even in her sons relative professional stability she suspected the deceptive tranquility that precedes cataclysms she used to say that she had accompanied the doctor to the camões high school entrance exam and that when she looked out the living room window she saw all the children leaning towards the subject focused and attentive with the exception of the psychiatrist who with his chin in the air completely oblivious was absentmindedly studying the ceiling light and from that example i immediately realized what his life was going to be like concluded his mother with the triumphantly modest smile of the bandarras with aim to find peace with his conscience however he tried to combat the inevitable by asking the school principal every year to put his son in a front desk "right in front of the teacher" so that the doctor could forcibly drink the effluvia of the decomposition of polynomials the classification of insects and other notions of undeniable usefulness instead of the verses she wrote secretly in her notebooks the psychiatrists course full of adventures had taken on the proportions of a stormy war for her in which promises to our lady of fátima alternated with punishments sighs of pain tragic prophecies and complaints to her aunts desolate witnesses of so much unhappiness who always believed themselves personally affected by the most insignificant family earthquake now looking out the drawing teachers secondfloor window the doctor remembered his spectacular failure in the practical anatomy test in which he had been handed a slimy jar with the subclavian artery inside painted red among a tangle of rotting tendons how the formaldehyde from the cadavers irritated his eyelids and how after weighing the four volumes of the treatise on bones and muscles and joints and nerves and vessels and organs on the kitchen scales he had declared to himself in front of those six and eight hundred kilos of compact science fuck me if im going to study this shit at that time he was struggling to compose a long terrible poem inspired by nabokovs pale fire and he believed that he had within him the broad strength of claudels great odes tempered by the restraint of t s eliot the absence of talent is a blessing he realized; its just that it takes a while to get used to it and having assumed his condition as an ordinary man reduced to the rare partridge flights of occasional poetry without the hump of immortality clinging to his back he felt free to suffer without originality and exempt from surrounding his silences with the wall of taciturn intelligence that he associated with genius the psychiatrist walked around the amoreiras garden close to the houses to smell the smell of the sun on the facades the brightness that the lime absorbed like the fruit drank the light on a wall to which the remains of posters stuck like rags to a bald nape he read something written in charcoal the people freed the comrade henry tenrey and the acronym of the anarchists below an ironic a in a circle a blind man walking ahead of him tapped his cane on the sidewalk with a noise of indecisive castanets a dead city thought the doctor a dead city in a tiled urn waiting without hope for those who will never come again blind people pensioners and widows and salazar who god willing did not die there was a patient in his hospital a very serious and restrained alentejan mr joaquim always wearing a floppy hat and impeccable overalls who was in constant and direct communication with the former president of the council whom he respectfully called “our teacher” and from whom he received secret orders for the conduct of public affairs a republican guard in a remote village on the plains he one day took up his shotgun against his fellow countrymen intending to force them to build a prison in caxias in accordance with the instructions that our teacher whispered in his ear from time to time the psychiatrist received letters from mr joaquims village signed by the prior or the fire chief asking them not to release that terrifying emissary of a ghost one morning the doctor called mr joaquim into his office and told him what the nurses did not have the courage to say mr joaquim our teacher passed away more than three weeks ago his photo was even published in the newspaper mr joaquim went to the door to make sure no one was listening to them went back inside leaned over to the psychiatrist and informed him in a whisper it was all a pretense sir he put someone who looked like him there and the opposition took the bait a quarter of an hour ago he appointed me minister of finance you see our professor is giving them all the crap salazar you bastard who will never stop dying he thought at the time sitting at his desk faced with mr joaquims obstinacy how many mr joaquims are willing to blindfold a former seminarian with the soul of an abbots housekeeper counting pennies in the pantry deep down the doctor mused walking around jardim das amoreiras salazar has exploded but from his belly have emerged hundreds of little salazars willing to continue his work with the unimaginative zeal of stupid disciples hundreds of little salazars equally castrated and perverse running newspapers organizing rallies conspiring in the folds of their dona marias shouting in praise of corporatism in brazil and this in a country where there are afternoons like this perfect in color and light like a painting by matisse beautiful with the rigorous beauty of the monastery of alcobaca in a country of black tomatoes that the estado novo wanted to hide under cassock skirts oh mendes pinto and with many hail marys and much pillorying we went after them and in less than a creed we killed them all he entered the bar with the spirit of someone who enters the humid shade of a trellis in the heat of the day and before his pupils had gotten used to the semidarkness of the establishment he could only make out in a haze of darkness vague glows of lamps and reflections of bottles or metals like scattered lights of lisbon seen from the sea on foggy nights he stumbled towards the bar out of pure instinct a shortsighted dog on the way to the bone he supposedly had while little by little figures formed the teeth of a smile floated nearby an arm holding a glass waved to his left and a world of tables and chairs and some people appeared out of nowhere gained volume and consistency surrounded him and it was as if the sun outside and the trees and the stone arches of the jardim das amoreiras were suddenly very far away lost in the unreal dimension of the past a beer the doctor asked looking around he knew that the woman used to frequent that bar and was looking for something that would prolong her on the empty benches in the same way that a mattress hole announces the absence of a body a sign of her passing something that would allow him to reconstruct her next to him in living smiling flesh warm complicit a couple of heads together whispered in a corner a gigantic man vigorously patted the resigned shoulder of a friend turning his joints into fraternal mush who will you come here with the psychiatrists burning jealousy asked himself who will you talk about who will you lie down with in beds i dont know who will hold your hips in his hands who will occupy the place that was mine that is still mine in me a space of tenderness for my kisses a smooth deck for the mast of my penis who will sail closehauled in your belly the taste of the beer reminded him of portimão the smell of a diabetics breath from the sea at praia da rocha ruffled by the feminine breath of the east the first time they made love in a hotel in the algarve married the day before trembling with anguish and desire they were very young then and were learning the paths of pleasure from each other groping newborn foals eagerly nodding at the teat glued to each other in the enormous astonishment of discovering the true color of joy when we were making out at your parents house the doctor said faced with the ugly faces of the chinese masks i expected to hear your footsteps on the stairs the sound of your high heels on the steps and a rush of wind a rage a reverse urge to vomit grew inside me the hunger for you that has always been in me and made me come back early from montijo so we could lie down on the bedspread in the haste of someone who might die any minute made me get sudden erections just thinking about your mouth your voluptuous way of giving yourself the curve of your cupped shoulders your large tender soft breasts made me chew and chew your tongue wander over your neck enter you in a single movement of a sword in its sheath dazzled i have never come across a body like yours the doctor said as he poured the beer into the mug so suited to my human and inhuman measurements the authentic and the invented ones that are no less so for being so i have never come across such a great and good capacity to meet another person of absolute coincidence of being understood without speaking and of understanding the silence and emotions and thoughts of others that it has always been a miracle to me that we met on the beach where i met you thin dark fragile your ancient serious profile resting on your bent knees the cigarette you smoked the beer just like this one on the bench at your side your perpetual animallike attention the many silver rings on your fingers my wife forever and my only wife my lamp for the dark portrait of my eyes september sea my love and why is it that i only know how to like he asked himself examining the bubbles of gas stuck to the glass wall why is it that i only know how to say that i like through the little rounds of periphrases and metaphors and images the concern to beautify to put crochet fringes on feelings to pour exaltation and anguish into the pindaric cadence of the fado menor soul swaying corny like correia de oliveira in a samarra if all this is clean clear direct without the need for prettiness dry like a giacometti in an empty room and as simply eloquent as he is laying words at the feet of a sculpture is equivalent to the useless flowers that are given to the dead or the dance of the rain around a full well damn it to me and to the saccharine romanticism that runs through my veins my eternal difficulty in uttering words as dry and precise as stones he lifted his chin took a sip and let the liquid run down his spine in a sulphuric stearin slowness that shook off the lassitude of his nerves angry with himself and with the twisted members of the womens chronicle who had engraved themselves in his brain the architect of his own pyre despite van goghs warning i have tried to express the terrible human passions with red and green the brutal simplicity of the painters phrase sent shivers down his spine as it did for example when listening to mozarts requiem or lester youngs saxophone in these foolish things running along the music like wise fingers on a sleeping buttock he ordered another beer and called the waiter who was explaining to the friend of the very large man the reasons for his complaint against his sons french teacher and dialed the number that the redhaired girl had given him and that he had noted on the torn page of the missions newspaper the bell rang nine or ten times in vain he hung up and dialed again on the assumption that there had been a needle error in the companys cables and that marlene dietrichs voice would now answer him through the black bakelite holes tiny and clear as pinocchios cricket finally he handed the phone back to the waiter isnt your aunt here he asked with the ironic affection of the captains of alcohol ships preparing for the long night crossing it may be that the congress of the daughters of mary could go on for a long time suggested the gentleman who was climbing aboard the fourth gin and had begun to find the floors sloping or he is explaining circumcision in catechism class added the friend who belonged to the class of those who do not like to be left behind and are anxiously trying to keep up with the rest or shit on me said the doctor to the unused bottle of beer one of the advantages of bars he thought is that you can talk to the bottlenecks without the risk of getting into trouble or fighting and suddenly in the space of a second he understood the drunks not technically at the expense of the explanations from outside to inside of psychiatry which were exaggeratedly right and therefore wrong but with a gut understanding made of the desire to escape that was his on so many occasions the calm mans index finger touched him with unexpected delicacy on the shoulder little brother we are alone on deck but there are girls in diving suits waiting in singapore his friend added so that the platoon wouldnt escape him the calm man looked at him with the maj static contempt of gin you say that this is a mans conversation and to the doctor confidentially and fraternally when we leave here well go to cova da onca to drown our miseries in the swamp whores his friend grumbled sulkily the big guys pincers squeezed his elbow until it snapped less than your mother my bardamerdas addressing the empty tables authoritatively anyone who talks bad about women in front of me is screwed his face twisted with threatening fury looking for a target to point at but apart from the couple absorbed in their corner in a complicated game of butting and groping and the dimly lit lamps we found ourselves without passengers on the raft condemned to each others company as thought the psychiatrist on barbed wire in africa by the end of the commission they were already playing king with intonations of hatred in their throats tingling slaps in their fingers anger ready to shoot out of their uncocked mouths why is it that i continually remember hell he wondered because i havent escaped from it yet or because ive replaced it with another kind of torture he drank half of the beer like someone taking an unpleasant medicine and tore into as small pieces as he could the phone number of the redhaired girl who at that time must have been telling her boyfriend about the fun she had had at the expense of some idiot in the dentists waiting room he imagined their laughter and with it in his ears he finished off what was left of the beer until there was a foamy slop left in the glass fermented rye snail put the little twigs of the drunkard in the sun and help me float because i cant swim and he remembered a story that was part of the family heritage that of a couple who were friends of his grandmother the fonsecas in which the robust woman tyrannized her short husband mr fonseca for example would make a timid sound and she would immediately shout fonseca doesnt talk because fonseca is stupid mr fonseca would go to light a cigarette and she would croak fonseca doesnt smoke and so on one afternoon the grandmother was serving tea to a group of visitors and when she arrived mr fonseca asked “mr fonseca green or black” the woman of mr fonseca attentive like a guard dog with a gallbladder gurgled fonseca doesnt drink tea; and in the silence that followed an astonishing phenomenon occurred mr fonseca until then and during forty years of conjugal dictatorship meek obedient and resigned put his fist on the arm of the chair and announced in a voice muffled by his unhinged testicles i want green and i want black its time the doctor said paying for the bottles and freeing himself from the embrace of the calm man who had meanwhile reached the stage of embraces its time to make a fucking jet come out of his balls that we can see it was getting dark outside perhaps that night the woman would come to that bar and not even notice the stone arches in the garden as usual im going to be late for my analysis session thought the psychiatrist stopped at a red light to whom he was currently placing full responsibility for all the misfortunes in the world his own at the top of the list of course he was in the side lane of avenida da republica behind a cargo van and he was shaking with impatience as he watched the traffic that was running perpendicular to him coming from campo pequeno an irregular brick mosque a cathedral of horns two very pretty girls walked past the car chatting to each other and the doctor followed the movement of their shoulder blades and thighs as they walked the perfect harmony like a bird in flight of their gestures the way one of them brushed her hair back with her hand when i was younger he remembered i was sure that no woman would ever be interested in me in my broad chin in my thinness; i always felt shy and stuttered if someone looked at me feeling myself blush fighting the violent desire to disappear at a gallop when i was fourteen or fifteen they took me to the hundred on rua do mundo for the first time i had never been to bairro alto at night in that accumulation of narrow shadows and motionless figures and i entered the house of pass at the same time curious and terrified with the desire to pee from the exams hindering my walk i sat down in a room of mirrors and chairs next to a woman in a slip who was crocheting and didnt even lift her chin from the needles and in front of an elderly man who was waiting his turn with his briefcase on his knees and the relief of the coffee with milk terms from lunch could be seen on the briefcase and suddenly i saw myself multiplied to the point of nausea in the beveled mirrors dozens of afflicted selves staring at each other in amazement of terror of course my dick had shrunk in my underpants to the size it was when i got out of the cold shower a harmonium of wrinkled skin capable at most of peeing obliquely and i disappeared down the corridor at the humble trot of a chased dog towards the door where the boss with varicose veins spilling out of her slippers was arguing with a drunk soldier who had crossed the threshold with his boot covered in a jelly of vomit the light turned green and immediately the taxi behind him honked imperiously why on earth are taxi drivers he wondered the most sour creatures in the world and also faceless men reduced to the back of their necks and shoulders planted like nails in the front seat and occasionally to a pair of empty eyes in the little square of the rearview mirror expressionless glass orbs like those of the animals in the waterwheels maybe driving around lisbon all day long throws people into a kind of explosive epilepsy maybe this city makes people angry and disgusted by those who have to travel around it in every direction maybe the individuals nature is the murderous exaltation in fringes and we the restrained ones walk around here pretending to be kind when we dont have it he laughed at the driver who responded with a gigantic cuff like two scouts making flag signals to each other and turned right onto joão xxi where the beginning on the left side was behind sooty buildings that he liked with their canopies protruding like warts from precarious nests where ironing boards and domestic melancholies could be glimpsed my friend cesário the psychiatrist said tenderly last week i saw something that would bring alexandrines of joy to your mouth i was looking for a place to have dinner and passing close to your illuminated bust on the verge of stephanic grass where they had placed it i came across an old woman in black sitting on the step of the statue with a basket at her feet and then i understood the difference that goes between you and eca and which is the same difference that separates the embrace of a stone virgin from the proximity of a living creature torn from the solidity of the flesh of your verses he crossed a street of garages and workshops immersed in the darkness of finished work with the yellow awning of a brazilian bar at the end the portuguese are stupid the galician water carrier informed him of his mothers story we came here to sell them their water and parked next to a furniture store on the corner of avenida oscar monteiro torres and rua augusto gil displaying detestable dressers and oval oil paintings of flowers in carved frames a pastel depicting a greyhound against a background of velázquezs infanta was in the window and the dog seemed to smile the knowing smile that sometimes escapes a foolish painter and through which lack of talent mocks itself without realizing it for some time he looked in amazement at a phenomenal aluminum chandelier thinking how bad taste required in its own way a considerable dose of imagination and wishing to try lying down on a bed taken from dr mabuses nightmares on a night of digestive failure to see what delirious metamorphoses his body would undergo to the immense astonishment of the maid who had recently arrived from the provinces and whom his father had taken to visit the zoo this is the elephant his father explained and the maid looked at the animal in amazement studying its legs its head its trunk; here is the rhinoceros his father said here is the hippopotamus here is the gorilla here is the ostrich and the maid went from astonishment to astonishment round eye sockets open mouth hands clasped until they reached the giraffes enclosure there the girls surprise reached its climax for minutes dazzled she contemplated the long neck covered in spots and the head up there until she approached the doctors father and asked in a whisper sir what is this persons name its the giraffe they announced to him the maid chewed on the word for a long time always observing the animal and murmured in a sigh of ecstasy giraffe… what a wellplaced name it was completely dark and in the darkness of a doorway the psychiatrist could make out a group of cape verdeans with smoked glasses arguing passionately waving their lightcolored shirt sleeves in broad gestures one of them carried a batterypowered radio under one arm that suddenly spurted out a burst of very loud music like a flushing toilet discharging a mess of fusas there was a tavern a little further on with a television set on a shelf near the ceiling and the regulars glasses in hand turned their heads in unison towards the screen that shone upon them a fluorescent blue light of radioscopy revealing the skeleton of their smiles judging by the dialectical enthusiasm of the cape verdeans the doctor guessed that they had strengthened their vociferous moods with the tonic of the red wine whose presence could be sensed in every exclamation or laugh from the neighboring ground floor a fat lady watched the scene very interested spilling her breasts on the windowsill she must be wearing the enamel portrait of father cruz around her neck the psychiatrist bet as he climbed the stairs on his way to the analysis she must have a plump dog called benfica a son who works as a banker and a granddaughter named sonia marisa with a plastic visor on the left lens of her glasses to distort her vision maybe he added ringing the doorbell shell be the maid of honor at the dentists maids wedding and theyll talk about income on sunday afternoons while the couple listens to the story of the lottery bet on their knees make things up make things up the guys already peeled off he warned himself on his way to the group room after the door opened with a sharp click of the lid lately in his opinion he had been taking too many beatings from the analyst just like when he was little they punished him for mistakes that in his opinion were none of his business and a great resentment was growing in him against the other who seemed to take pleasure in destroying one by one the vapid but necessary architectures of his chimeras a guy is here like a tame ox in the slaughterhouse the doctor reflected taking pins in the bells of sadistic butchers and if he holds on its in the sole hope that later his meat will become more tender; a guy is here learning to live or to be tamed castrated brainless transformed into a secular saint for two thousand and something a month what the hell is this that i leave here twisted like an old man with rheumatism lumbago sciatica parrots beak and toothache the soul of a mongrel whining on the way home and yet i come back i come back punctually every other day to receive more bullshit or total indifference and no answer to my concrete anxieties no idea about how to get out of this pit or at least see a glimpse of open air up there no gesture that shows me the direction of a certain tranquility a certain peace a certain harmony with myself freud that jewish whore who gave birth to you is going to get fucked in the ass by your oedipus he opened the door to the group and instead of declaring shit to everyone he said good afternoon and sat down disciplined in the only free chair in the room the group was complete five women three men with him and the group analyst sitting in his usual place with his eyes closed playing with his wristwatch resting on the arm of the chair you bastard thought the psychiatrist you fucking bastard in one of these sessions ill kick you in the ass to see if youre alive and as if he had understood the psychoanalyst stood up to he the somnambulant and neutral eyelid that immediately turned to a painting on the wall of the room that approximately represented a village landscape roofs of various colors a church tower a stormy sky through the open window came attenuated the discussion of the cape verdeans in the street and the music on the radio that had now reached cruising intensity; through the curtains one could make out the outlines of the neighboring buildings a sign that life went on outside that apparently watertight compartment a repository of concentrated afflictions one of the women was talking about her father and how difficult it was for her to get close to him and the doctor who had heard the description dozens of times and found it particularly boring and monotonous spent his time observing the walls that needed a new coat of paint the black and white armchairs that looked like obese penguins a table in the corner covered with a poorquality red tablecloth with a telephone and two tattered lists on top this was where the therapist placed the envelopes for the fees which contained numbers from 1 to 31 and circles in ballpoint pen representing the dates of the sessions one of the men whom he greatly liked was dozing with his chin in his hand this is like parliament today thought the psychiatrist who in turn felt invaded by a very light kind of drowsiness a film of sluggish indifference that disturbed his attention the woman who had been talking about her father suddenly fell silent and another woman began a long account of her sons suspected meningitis which had not been confirmed after a lengthy via sacra by hospital benches and doctors with contradictory diagnoses all concerned with disdainfully refuting the opinion of their previous colleague the man who had been dozing woke up stretched and asked her for a cigarette to his right an orphanlooking girl was sucking on tonsil lozenges occasionally clicking her tongue the corners of her mouth were drooping and bitter like the eyebrows of very sad people i have been coming here for i dont know how many years reflected the doctor observing his fellow travelers most of whom had begun to navigate the waters of analysis before him and i still dont know you well or have learned to know you to understand what you want from life what you expect from it there are times when i am away from here and i think about you and miss you and then i ask myself what you mean to me and i dont know the answer because i still dont know most of the answers and i stumble from question to question like galileo before he discovered that the earth moved and found in that explanation the key to his questions and he added what explanation will i find one day that the holy office will come to condemn it and who will force me to give up my small individual conquests painful victories of shit over the shit of which i am made he took a cracked ashtray from the central table and lit a cigarette for himself the smoke entered his lungs with the greed of air through an empty balloon and flooded his body with a kind of calm enthusiasm the psychiatrist he saw his first clandestine tobacco stolen from his mother sucked at the age of eleven through the bathroom window in a delight of great adventure chesterfield his mother would light them at the end of lunch next to the coffee machine tray surrounded by her children and husband and the doctor would watch the smoke that accumulated around the iron lamp on the ceiling forming and undoing stretched blue clouds transparent and slow like summer cirrus clouds his father would tap his pipe on the silver ashtray with the inscription smoke flies friendship stays in the center a great serenity would spread through the dining room and the psychiatrist had the comforting certainty that no one among those present would ever die sixteen pairs of clear eyes around the silver flowerpot united by the similarity of their features and by a brieflong common past some members of the group asked the girl about the details of her sons illness and the doctor noticed that the analyst who looked cataleptic was using his fingernail to clean a stain on his red and black tie with branches this bastard he thought besides being ugly dresses worse and worse he doesnt even need socks with stars here he is dressed in formal attire for a reception at a pastry shop on avenue paris accompanied by the fat lady with plum colored satins and a rabbit fox with psoriasis on her neck deep down he wished the analyst would dress according to his own standards of elegance which were debatable and vague when it came to him one of his brothers used to tell him that he a psychiatrist looked like a photograph of a provincial groom startled in a poorly tailored striped jacket i dress up like alices white rabbit and demand that those i care about put on the mad hatters uniform perhaps then we can all play croquet with the queen of hearts cut the neck of the everyday at one stroke and leap through the lookingglass together and then he said to himself your majesty must not roar so loudly but anyway what is the light of a candle when it is extinguished the third man in the group who wore glasses and looked like emilio and the detectives explained that he would like his daughter to die so he could receive more attention from his wife which provoked murmurs of varied indignation from the audience fuck fuck said the dozing man fidgeting in his chair seriously the first one insisted there are moments when i feel like going over to the crib and pouring a pot of boiling coffee into it oh my said the woman with meningitis looking for her handkerchief in her purse there followed a silence which the psychiatrist took advantage of to light another cigarette and the parricide took off his glasses and suggested quietly maybe we all want to kill the people we love the group analyst began to wind the clock and the doctor felt like alice in the assembly of animals presided over by dodo what strange mechanics! internal governs all this he thought and what underground thread unites disconnected phrases and gives them a meaning and density that escape me are we on the threshold of silence as in certain poems by benn in which the phrases acquire unsuspected weight and the meaning at once mysterious and obvious of dreams or could it be that like alberti tonight i feel mortally wounded the words and i feed on what in their interstices sparkles and pulsates when the flesh turns into sound where is the flesh and where is the sound and where is the key that makes it possible to decode this morse to make it concrete and simple like hunger or the urge to urinate or the longing of a body he opened his mouth and said i miss my wife one of the girls who had not yet spoken smiled at him kindly and this encouraged him to continue i miss my wife and i cant tell her or anyone else except you why the group analyst asked unexpectedly as if he were returning to the secret of a long journey through the ice of his own self his voice opened up a pleasant space in front of him where the psychiatrist felt like lying down i dont know he answered quickly afraid that the receptiveness he had achieved would disappear and he would find himself faced with eight bored or hostile faces i dont know or i do know it depends i think the love that others have for me and i have for them scares me a bit and im afraid of living that to the end completely giving myself over to things and fighting for them while i have the strength and when the strength runs out finding more strength to continue the fight and he spoke of the immense love that had united his paternal grandfather and grandmother for almost fifty years and of the way in which the older children and grandchildren had to stamp their feet on the floor to let them know when he had entered a room where they were alone he saw them holding hands at the dining room table during family dinners and of the way in which his grandfather would caress his wife and call her “my old lady” and put a deep warm and indestructible tenderness into that call she spoke of her grandfathers death and of the courage with which her grandmother had endured illness agony and death standing firm and with dry eyes and her great suffering could be seen beneath her absolute tranquility without sentimentality or lamentations of any kind and how she had followed straight and shaken the urn of her husband to the grave she had received with a polite smile the condolences of the officer who commanded the escort for her husbands military burial and on her return home she had distributed her fathers personal objects to her children and had immediately organized her life in such a way that everything would remain as she and we knew her grandfather would have wanted and at mealtime she sat at the head of the bed and we accepted this as a natural fact and that was how it remained until eighteen years later when she died in her turn and wanted to carry the photograph he had given her for their silver wedding anniversary in her coffin and she spoke of what the priest had said to her he said at her funeral mass that it was we have all lost a mother and the doctor thought a lot about this phrase he had said about his grandmother whose lack of tenderness and harshness irritated him and he ended up agreeing that it was true and that in thirty years of his life he had not known how to give that woman the value she really had and that once again he had made a mistake in measuring people and now it was too late as usual to make amends you cant wipe the past clean but you can live better in the present and the future and youre so scared of that observed the smiling girl at least as long as there is a need to continue to punish added the analyst who was intensely studying the nail on his left thumb to which the complete works of melanie klein must have been glued on microfilm the psychiatrist leaned back in his chair and searched his pocket for his third cigarette of the session do i punish myself like this he mused and if i do why the hell do i do it and in the name of what nebulous and for me unattainable sin or do i simply do it because i am incapable of anything else and this is my peculiar way of feeling in the world like an alcoholic has to drink to be sure he exists or a man has to fornicate to be sure he is a man and we inevitably end up with the essential question which lies behind all the others when all the others have moved away or have been moved away and which is if you will allow me who am i i ask myself and the answer is obsessively invariably like this shit why do you hate yourself asked the parricide maybe for the same reason that uncle jose used to ride into my grandfathers kitchen replied the doctor and he told how his uncle jose whom he had never met would spend months completely immobile sitting by a window without speaking to anyone until he would suddenly get up put a carnation in his tailcoat mount his mare and begin a period of feverish business activity and cabarets in between which he would trot quixotic with decrepit joy into the homes of his nephews and friends neither uncle jose knew why he rode among pots and pans and the screams of indignant cooks nor i because i dont care said the psychiatrist and he added softly in the tone of someone completing some inner journey my greatgrandfather killed himself with two pistols when he discovered he had cancer you are not your greatgrandfather explained the analyst scratching his elbow and this guermantes of yours is just a guermantes live among the dead so as not to live among the living said the girl with the problems with her father it sounds like a voiceover talking about a photo album why dont you look at us who are breathing asked the parricide and for you as one who breathes suggested the one with the smile you are like the children in bed afraid of the dark pulling the blankets over their heads what kind of cat makes these squares fall on me at one oclock the doctor asked himself the big guys are falling on the blind invalid he complained with the biggest smile he could muster before the blind invalid who is neither blind nor invalid tries to fool the big guys and fool himself so that he can continue to have the advantage of being blind and invalid replied the melancholic woman with the angina very quickly we dont buy into the siren song of your selfpity and if you like to take it in the asshole of the soul thats up to you but dont force us to watch the show there was a great silence filled with the muffled noise of the traffic below night traffic the oblique gliding of a cat through the illuminated city in a few minutes ill be alone in the neon thought the psychiatrist pulling on his mule to choose a restaurant where to have dinner; and each of these bastards has someone waiting for them this last observation made an enormous rage rise up inside him against the others who were better defending themselves from the gelatinous octopus of depression its easy for a rooster to crow on a perch he shouted in a circle accompanying the shout of obscenities with both hands one wants to kill his daughter the other sends us to that part protested one of the girls laughing you are a bunch of dots inventing cardboard anxieties roof cats that instead of being in heat meow threats of sadness have perfected the one for meningitis the analyst blew his nose noisily and put the ball of his handkerchief without folding it in his trouser pocket it was as if he were watching the conversation with absolute indifference given over to the passivity of vegetable ruminations the inner self of this fat man still young was a complete enigma to the psychiatrist although for years they had met three times a week in that room as neglected as the owners appearance with a sacristy curtain at the entrance and a ceiling brown with innumerable cigarettes where much of his life was played out he surreptitiously glanced at the watch of the sleepyhead next to him a few more minutes and the analyst would rest his fingers on the arms of the chair and get up to end the session go down the stairs go out into the street start again climb up the well by force to the grassy landscape outside wring out his wet clothes leave like when i arrived from africa and didnt know what to do and found myself in a very long corridor with no door and had a pregnant wife and daughter and a vast tiredness in my bones rattling from too many bites he mentally reviewed ze do telhados tomb in dala and mr gaspars house with a thatched roof amidst the tall trees where a huge tame monkey with a white snout was jumping around tied by a leash to an iron post he reviewed corporal pereiras death in the unimog fire and the fantastic nighttime fires since they took me to padua to make my first communion the doctor thought ive been around a long time sorry about the cardboard anxieties said the girl who had moments before he had laughed at him i know youre a bit lazy the psychiatrist grazed her arm as the group analyst began to stand up and gave her a sidelong glance from calvary my daughter he assured me today you will be with me in paradise alone in the night on augusto gil street sitting in his car with the engine off and the lights off the psychiatrist rested his hands on the steering wheel and began to cry he did his best not to make a sound so that his shoulders shook like those of silent film actresses hiding his curls and tears in the embrace of a bearded grandfather fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck he said to himself because he could find no other words within me than those a kind of weak protest against the deep sadness that filled me i felt very helpless and very alone and now i had no desire to call out for anyone because i knew there are crossings that can only be made alone without help even at the risk of sinking in one of those sleepless nights that turn us pedro and inês into a crypt in alcobaca lying in stone until the end of the world and i remembered someone telling me that when she was a child her mother used to take her on visits at a time when people interacted with one another on tiptoe with excessive delicacy; and then she would enter stiff houses filled with large clocks and pianos with candlesticks where the music tends to tremble in the direction of the wind she would listen to the lamentations of the ladies drowned by the damask of the curtains and the sighs of the dead in the portraits on the wall and she would think how sad this house must be at three oclock in the afternoon so that year after year she would pour alcohol from the pharmacies into the flower vases to drink it in secret and thus achieve a perpetual noon the night in the streets and squares that friday seemed to the doctor like the nights he had spent in his childhood when he would lie in bed and listen to the opera duets that would reach his bed in the form of terrifying arguments his tenor father and soprano mother shouting insults at each other against the backdrop of a sinister orchestra that the darkness would amplify until one of them would hang the other with a c sharp noose followed by the terrible silence of the tragedies that had taken place someone was lying on the carpet in a puddle of eighth notes murdered with flats and a few blackclad conductors would soon be climbing the stairs carrying a coffin that looked like a double bass case with a crucifix of two crossed batons on the top the maids in crests and starched aprons were singing the hunters chorus in a beira accent in the dining room the priest dressed as don jose appeared in a spanish whirlwind of daughters of mary and the german shepherd from the tannery sent out into the land the howls of the baskerville hound revised by saintsaëns at night in lisbon one feels as if one is living in a eugene süe novel with a page for the tagus river where barão de sabrosa street is the faded ribbon marking the reading spot despite the rooftops where television antennas bloom like miro bushes the psychiatrist who never used a handkerchief wiped his snot and tears with the green cloth he used to wipe the warm breath of a nativity scene cow from the car window and turned on the lights the illuminated display always seemed like a village to him alentejo at a party observed from afar and started the engine of the small car whose work was transmitted to his body as if he too were a part of that soft vibrating machine in a doorway right next to him a young girl was kissing a bald gentleman on the mouth her kidneys had the sensual harmony of certain quick drawings by stuart and the doctor envied intensely the ugly little man who was caressing her rolling his protuberant eyes like boiled sea bream the yellow american car with green windows parked there undoubtedly belonged to him the plastic skeleton hanging from the rearview mirror was on the same wavelength as the ring he wore on his little finger with a gold pound held by three silver teeth if i married my washerwomans daughter perhaps i would be happy the psychiatrist recited aloud looking at the man who was making the boiling noises through his open mouth the kind made by people with false teeth when drinking overly hot coffee when i am his age i will eat kisses like someone eating soup and i will pick my gums at the end to extract the uncomfortable remains of tenderness from my molars; and perhaps a girl like this will be interested in my grace of lying oh darkness darkness darkness shapeless night here dripping liquid from the houses born at ground level from the asphalt from the lakes from the boxwoods from the still silence of the river from the chests and chests of drawers in the corridors of the old houses filled with the clothes of the dead the doctor reached defensores de chaves and drove slowly in the foolish hope that time would pass very quickly and three blocks ahead he would find himself forty and happy in a house in estoril surrounded by pedigreed greyhounds good bookbindings and blond children because what he knew before him was a restless agitated sadness of which he could not make out the end if there was one i usually used to combat these states by sleeping from hotel to hotel from the rex to the impala from the impala to the penta from the penta to the impala and suffering in the morning the strange impact of waking up in an impersonal and strange room approaching the window and seeing the usual city below the usual traffic the usual people and me stateless in my homeland washing my armpits with a sample of feno de portugal soap a gift from the management and leaving the keys at the reception in a false vacation ease the psychiatrist walked around jose fontana square where for the first time when he had come from high school he had seen two dogs making love chased by the remarkable puritanical rage of the chestnut seller who in the summer drove an ice cream tricycle thus displaying the enviable malleability of national politicians; for seven years he had crossed the trees of that garden every day populated in equal doses by pensioners and children with the underground urinal under the bandstand guarded by a cerberus councilman enjoying the oscillating vapors of a chronic drunkenness since dawn the doctor always imagined him secretly married to the woman who sold ice cream chestnuts to whom he would join in a the sound of a windshield wiper as dusk approaches mixing the burps of alcohol with the polar breath of vanilla in the bridal chamber of the toilets decorated with explanatory drawings just as the posters at first aid stations explain the ins and outs of mouthtomouth resuscitation an elderly homosexual with his cheeks made up walked between the benches observing the students with the look of a sticky candy and a dignified gentleman with a briefcase sitting next to the fountain was negotiating pornographic photographs with the missionary spirit of someone who at the doors of churches foists holy cards on children receiving their first communion when he arrived at duque de loule the illuminated advertisements for chinese restaurants cuneiform culinary characters for the use of the idiosyncrasies made him hesitate indecisive tempted by the exotic names of the dishes but he immediately thought that dining alone would make him feel even more alone balancing without an umbrella on the wire of his distress in front of an indifferent public so he parked the car lower down almost touching a telephone booth just like the one whose picture he had seen weeks ago in a magazine crammed with smiling bodies with the caption new world record thirtysix english students in a telephone booth the receiver resting on the cradle made him want to call his wife i love you i never stopped loving you lets fight together for us and so he almost galloped away and dashed down the stairs of noite e dia towards the snack bar in the basement beating the doorman who looked like his fourth grade teacher in the act of pushing open the glass door at the entrance in the mangers with their long counters a kind of last supper solidarity was established that helped the psychiatrist to remain standing from within as if his left elbow and his right elbow worked like splints that held together the shattered bones of his despair and prevented them from scattering on the floor like pieces of mikado he sat between a serious little boy prematurely dressed as a sad librarian and a couple in crisis bristling with silent marital hatred smoking angrily their eyes fixed on the horizon of a contentious divorce he asked the waiter for a quick steak and a glass of water and stood watching the diners opposite most of them girls who took turns at a nearby cabaret motionless over their coffees like priests at petrified eucharists their hands with their enormous red nails held contraband american cigarettes with whose smoke they ritually incensed the cups and the doctor amused himself by discovering on their faces beneath the shoddy makeup and the false expressions learned from the eden films the wrinkles that childhoods of deprivation forever imprint on the corners of their mouths and the angles of their eyelids indelible hieroglyphics of misery when he was single he sometimes frequented the prostitutes bars located on the fringes of the bairro alto in dark crooked alleys like hollow eye sockets to hearing them invent moving virtuous adolescences like corin tellado in front of lukewarm beers and imminent futures of shipwreck with no survivors fucking capitalism he thought you havent even forgotten these misfortunes; lets die and long live the bastard system plus the world wars with which you resolve your crises of agony lower the unemployment rate at the cost of millions of victims shuffle the cards and start the game again since as the other one rhymes after all what matters is not that there are people who are hungry because just like that there are still plenty of people who eat he would sometimes accompany them in a taxi to the rooms where they lived without elevators and he would be amazed by the furniture made of crates the portraits in wire frames and the cardboard suitcases of clothes lined with blue paper with little stars like the inside of the envelopes these girls the psychiatrist was surprised have preserved intact the tastes and preferences of the provincial servants they must have been despite the drugstore mascara and the insecticidelike perfumes with which they disguise themselves; there remains in them an atavistic authenticity that transcends me who was brought up between seventhday masses and good manners and when they clean their pillowcases in the enamel washbasin and lie down on the bed to sleep the ceiling light hanging from the cord without a lampshade like an outoforbit eyeball resembles the lamp in guernica illuminating a devastated landscape and here i am in mortal sin like someone who takes communion without having confessed chewing his steak his chin on the plate the doctor felt the tension of the couple on his left approaching the gaseous state of a furious argument the high tide sweeping away from the sand of the past the debris of pleasant memories the difficulties endured together the illnesses of the children spied on in a sudden rush of concern the man was grinding the car keys his nostrils wide open crushing them in his trembling hands; the woman with a smile of defiance on her lips was banging her coffee spoon against her beer glass to the rhythm of a military drum her profile contracted like that of a cat preparing to leap resembled that of the scowls of fountains embodied in stone rages the boy librarian on the other side was explaining the plot of cousin basilio to the fat lady who was with him with the dignified selfsufficiency of the extremely stupid one could guess in him the supreme court judge or the president of a general meeting of a sports club uttering pompous inanities with a deep air and the psychiatrist felt for the creature the flow of sincere pity that he dedicated to those who were unaware of the existence of others walled in by irremediable imbecility two foreigners came down the stairs and sat down next to the girls from the cabaret who immediately began to move around like hunting dogs a blonde with large breasts covered by a very tight sweater smiled at them cheekily and the doctor felt a fraternal erection strain in his trousers while the foreigners whispered to each other about the strategy to follow it was clear that they were swaying between the embarrassment and desire divided the blonde took a halfmeter long cigarette holder from her purse and asked one of them for a light staring at him without taking her eyes off him her chest grew in her tight sweater like a dove in heat and the foreigner drew back frightened by the carnivorous plant that threatened him; rummaging through his pockets he ended up finding a box of matches advertising an airline; a distressed flame wavered youve just arrived my sacristan thought the doctor starting the mousse and observing the foreigners astonished face youve just arrived and youre already going to cum like you never dreamed you could cum in your fucking life like youve never cum in the aseptic coitus where youve been slacking off and he remembered the exact moment before ejaculation when his body transformed into a wave that rises in successive waves of pleasure each time stronger heavier denser suddenly bursts in an explosion of foam the size of the world in which pieces of us fly independently of us to every corner of the sheet and we fall asleep liquefied in a colorless limpness shipwrecked in joy due to tenderness he thought of a weekend he had spent with his wife after they had separated in a small inn in guincho perched on the cliff against the wind the seagulls and the slaps of sand at night and of the room they had occupied face to face with the sea with a narrow balcony as if floating above the water there lying side by side on the mattress they had loved each other with the wonder of rediscovering each other pore by pore in every caress in every long kiss in every journey of love and once again it was he who had not had the courage to continue who had given up terrified on fighting for both of them listen the psychiatrist articulated within himself scraping the mousse bowl listen you exist so deep within me with such numerous muscular and violent roots that nothing not even i will ever be able to cut them; and when i manage to overcome my cowardice my selfishness this mud of shit that prevents me from giving you and giving myself when i achieve that when i truly achieve that i will come back the blonde and one of the foreigners walked hand in hand towards duque de loule while the other was in turn being harassed by a small skinny brunette with the appearance of a vinegar fly expressing herself in broad gestures of frenetic commedia dellarte the quarreling couple left huffing and puffing their resentment they moved with the care of a processional float so as not to spill a single drop of their mutual anger the mother or wife of the boy librarian asked for the bill the waiters were chatting with the cook next to the coffee machine the last one to leave turns off the light thought the doctor remembering his childhood fear of the dark if i dont leave ill be screwed theres no one left here but me every night at approximately that time the psychiatrist would make the journey from the motorway and the marginal to return to the small unfurnished apartment where no one was waiting for him perched on monte estoril in a building that was too luxurious for his shyness the doormans desk in the enormous glass and metal lobby with a lake botanical garden plants and several stone slopes had a panel of buttons through which a disembodied voice from the last judgment echoed its domestic orders across the various floors with the divine sounds of a broken bucket or a garage at night mr ferreira the owner of that tremendous voice lived in the lower floors of the building protected by a safestyle door that the architect must have thought was appropriate for this pretentious bunker setting it was probably he who had painted the unforgettable greyhound in the furniture store or designed the imaginative aluminum chandelier these three remarkable lucubrations had a spark of common genius no less remarkable in fact was mr ferreiras living room which the doctor sometimes used for urgent telephone calls and where there was among other lesser wonders a student from coimbra playing the guitar in china a bust of pope pius xii with madeup eyes a bakelite donkey with plastic flowers in its saddlebags a large wall tapestry depicting a pair of tigers with the goodnatured air of the cows in the cheese triangles having lunch with the disgust of vegetarians on a gazelle that looked like a skinny rabbit staring at a horizon of holm oaks in the languid hope of a miracle the doctor always remained with the receiver in his hand forgetting about the call examining in amazement such an amazing achievement mr ferreiras wife who felt the instinctive sympathy for him that orphans arouse came out of the kitchen drying her hands on her apron the doctor really likes little tigers and he would stand next to the psychiatrist head tilted proudly contemplating his pets until mr ferreira appeared in his turn and uttered in his famous divine voice the phrase that summed up for him the climax of artistic admiration those bastards even seem to talk and in fact the doctor was waiting at any moment for one of the animals to turn its backwards eyes towards him and murmur “oh jesus” in a groan of distress driving the car along the highway paying attention to the volumes of shadow that the headlights successively discovered and devoured trees torn from the darkness in a tragic unreality tangled bushes the winding and trembling strip of pavement the psychiatrist thought that except for mr ferreiras tapestry estoril and he had nothing else that brought them together he had been born in a poor maternity hospital and had grown up and lived forever until he left home months before in a poor neighborhood without the luxury of houses with swimming pools and international hotels the estrela brilhante brewery was his garrett bakery with the cakes replaced by pipis and lupins and the ladies of the red cross by carris drivers who when they took off their peaked caps to wipe their foreheads with their handkerchiefs gave the impression of being naked downstairs from his parents lived maria feijoca the owner of the coal factory and in the house next door lived dona maria jose who dealt in shady contraband he knew the merchants by name and the neighbors by nicknames and his grandmothers greeted the saleswomen in the square with the greetings of chatelaines florentino a legendary perpetually drunk delivery boy whose torn clothes fluttered around his body like loose feathers would warn him whenever he came across him with a familiarity increased tenfold by the red your father is a close friend of mine waving to him from the tavern on the street of the cemetery that the sign on the way back here ill wait for you gave death the subordinate importance of a pretext the martelo agency why does your excellency insist on living if for five hundred escudos you can have a beautiful funeral displayed the urns and the little wax hands just above strategically halfway between the grave and the glass the doctor felt an immense tenderness for the benfica of his childhood transformed into povoa de santo adrião by the greed of the builders the tenderness that one dedicates to an old friend disfigured by multiple scars and in whose face one searches in vain for the complicit features of yesteryear when they knock down the pires building he said thinking of the enormous old building opposite his parents house what magnetic north will i use to orient myself i who have so few points of reference left and have so much difficulty in making new ones for myself and he imagined himself adrift in the city without a compass lost in a labyrinth of alleys because estoril would forever remain a foreign island to which he felt incapable of adapting far from the noises and smells of his native forest from the apartment he could see lisbon and looking at the sprawling city he felt it at the same time distant and close painfully distant and close like his daughters his wife and the attic with a sloping roof where they lived the pátio das cantigas she called it filled with prints books and childrens untidy toys it reached caxias with the waves crashing over the wall in vertical curtains there was no moon and the river merged with the sea in the black space to its left a gigantic deserted well of ship lights the red street lamps of monaco looked behind the damp glass of the restaurant like anaemic beacons in a storm i had dinner here when i got married thought the psychiatrist and there has never been a miraculous dinner like this again even the roast beef had a taste of surprise; at the end of the coffee i discovered that it was not necessary for the first time to take you home and that shot a formidable joy into my gut as if from that moment on my life as a man had begun opened up despite the imminence of war in a vigorous perspective of hope he remembered the car that his grandmother had lent them for their honeymoon and that had been the last one her husbands car and her sluggish work from birth she remembered the strange impression of the ring on her finger the suit she had worn for the first time that afternoon and her pathetic care with the creases i love you he repeated aloud gripping the steering wheel like a broken rudder i love you i love you i love you i love you i love you i love your body your legs your hands your pathetic animal eyes and it was like a blind man continuing to talk to a person who had tiptoed out of the room a blind man shouting towards an empty chair feeling the air feeling with his nostrils a smell that was evaporating if i go home now ill fuck myself he said i dont feel up to facing the bathroom mirror and all that silence waiting for me the bed closed in on itself like a sticky mussel and he remembered the bottle of brandy in the kitchen and that he could always sit on the wooden bench on the veranda glass in hand watching the way the buildings tumbled down to the beach dragging their terraces their trees their tortured gardens behind them he would sometimes fall asleep in the open air his head resting against the blind with a boat leaving the harbour sailing past his tired eyelids and in that way he would achieve some kind of peace until a hint of purple light mixed with sparrows would wake him up and force him to stumble towards the mattress like a sleepwalking child taking his nighttime wee and the bench on the veranda was covered in solidified bird droppings which he would pick off with his fingernails and which tasted like the brown of childhood secretly devoured during the brief absences of the cook absolute dictator of that principality of saucepans there were few cars on the route and the psychiatrist had been driving slowly on the righthand side of the road close to the pavement ever since one morning the previous week a stray seagull had hit the windshield with a soft feathery noise and the doctor had seen it already behind him trembling on the asphalt in agony the car following him had stopped next to the creature and he driving away had noticed in the mirror that the driver had gotten out heading towards the white mound on the asphalt growing smaller in the distance a wave of guilt and shame that he could not explain guilt for what shame for what swelled from his stomach to his mouth in a reflux of heartburn and for no apparent reason a severe phrase from chekhov came to mind “offer men men do not offer yourself”; then the psychiatrist remembered the seagull and the profound impression that reading the play had made on him of the apparently gentle characters adrift in an apparently gentle and amusing setting chekhov sincerely considered himself a comedian but laden with the terrifying anguish of life that only fitzgerald perhaps later knew how to rediscover and that appears at times in charlie parkers saxophone crucifying us suddenly in a desperate solo that sums up all the innocence and all the suffering of the world in the piercing breath of a note then the doctor thought that seagull is me and the one who runs away from me is me too and i dont even have the courage needed to go back and help myself on the way up and down estoril as he passed the grey bulk of the old fort with its enormous and hideous metal fish suspended above the dancing couples how long has it been since i was there the psychiatrist once again visualized the deserted apartment the bathroom mirror and the kitchen bottle next to the metal jug the only lifebuoys in the desolate silence of the house outside at the entrance to the building the dry leaves of the eucalyptus trees rustled constantly blown by the high wind with the sound of false teeth clashing against each other the tenants cars almost all of them luxurious and large pressed their noses against the wall like sullen children in his mailbox apart from the occasional forgotten brochure and the weekly cds propaganda sheet that he hurriedly slipped into the landladys locker without reading it emphatically declaring "give to caesar what belongs to caesar" there was never a letter for him he felt like garcía márquezs colonel inhabited by irremediable loneliness and the phosphorescent mushrooms in his gut waiting for news that never arrived that would never arrive and slowly rotting in that useless wait fed by a thousand vague promises so when the traffic light turned green in a sudden change of mood he turned right and headed towards the casino at the top of a sort of eduardo vii park in small stitch embroidered with hemophiliac palm trees whose branches creaked with protests of stubborn drawers of visconti hotels inhabited by hitchcock characters and onearmed car park attendants with hungry eyes hidden in the peaks of their caps like avid birds trapped in the furrowed net of their eyebrows the casino building resembled a large ugly ocean liner adorned among houses and trees beaten by the waves of music from the wonderbar by the hoarse cries of the croupiers seagulls and by the enormous silence of the maritime night around which rose a dense odor of cologne and poodle menstruation the trains leaving for lisbon from tamariz station carried with them on the empty seats the verses of that dylan thomas you liked so much in the final direction of the elementary town i advance for as long as forever is and the doctor imagined himself nodding in a deserted carriage duplicated on the other side of the glass through houses fragments of wall and lights of ships to the rhythm of the words of the poet that his wife used to take with her to bed and with whom she maintained a silent and perfect dialogue that excluded him for the lovers who pays no praise or wages nor heed my craft or art dylan thomas was the guy i was most jealous of to this day thought the psychiatrist abandoning the car in the protective shade of a tourist bus whose driver was explaining to an amazed taxi driver the intimate merits of french women of a certain age capable of making intercourse as light and easily digestible as an asparagus souffle i desperately hated dylan thomas and the tumultuously convincing poems with which that fat redhaired drunkard traveled with you to interior countries to which i had no access neighbors of the dreams of which faint echoes reached me through the loose words that you chewed in the ecstasy of a shipwrecked mermaid i hated dylan thomas without you even knowing it said the doctor walking over the damp night grass towards the deck of the casino and its crew disguised as majestic grooms exchanging ashtrays with slow gestures like vestals i hated that dead rival who came from the fog of the northern islands with a thoughtful corsairs smile on his innocent cheeks that welsh bastard who burst the thick dikes of language with windy phrases full of bells and horsehair that lover of foam that ghost with freckles that man who lived in a whiskey bottle like the collectors boats burning in his alcohol flame with the painful grace of a refractory phoenix caitlin said the psychiatrist exchanging vague de chirico smiles with the cabalistic doorman caitlin from new york i call you under the milk wood in this november of 1953 when i died with an island fading in the landscape of my head surrounded by the voracious rage of the albatrosses caitlin one of these days i will go down to tamariz and take an electric train to wales where you will wait for me in front of a tea as sad as the color of your eyes sitting in the room where nothing has changed with a thick pub smoke separating you solid from the rush of my kisses caitlin this distressed lighthouse bellow is my longing ox bellow searching for you this modulated locomotive whistle the love song i am capable of this noise of guts a moved start of tenderness these steps on the stairs my heart reaching out to you lets go back to the beginning clean up our lives start over play crapaud in the evening drink ginj a liqueur leave the trash can outside with the noise of a poor clown amidst the astonishment of the neighbors and the cats open a can of caviar and slowly eat the little grains of lead until having become poachers cartridges we fire at each other in the fireworks of a final explosion and that will be a little bit caitlin our way of leaving in the lobby of the casino a group of englishwomen who had disembarked from a bus as sumptuous as clark gables living room with its windows replaced by paintings by van eyck were bubbling with measured enthusiasm from their pale mouths a colonial colonel wearing black velvet in a white tuxedo shared his grey moustaches with two indian women in saris as enigmatic as queens of clubs who glided across the floor as if they were hiding rubber wheels in the complexity of their skirts transparent swedes with dark circles under their eyes from insomnia caused by long days of six months were supported by olivecoloured mexicans from elvas whom john wayne killed in film after film with the joy of an effective insecticide decrepit polish countesses leaned toward each other like collapsed question marks rouge floated around their wrinkles without sticking to their skin pollen that attracted senegalese insects with large globular eye sockets on whose fingers dozens of papal rings glistened from time to time the thighs clad in black stockings of the french ballet or the hugely open jaws of the tibetan sword swallower escaped through a gap in the restaurant curtains like jets of steam through cracks in a pan a fado singer wrapped in a shawl was absent in a tragic meditation on phaedra holding a glass of ritual gin in both hands obese gentlemen in unbuttoned waistcoats either left the chamber pot with the relieved air of having returned from the confessional or snored randomly on the sofas behind the windshield of the machines hundreds of voracious piggy banks clinked squeezing the excess from their stomachs into chrome bibs being here thought the doctor passing a wheelchair with a legless man inside is like waking up suddenly in the middle of the night with the impression that the bed has shifted position in the middle of the night dark and finding ourselves in a different country far from our familiar territorial waters under this vertical white light of a boxing ring that acts as a revealer showing us too many wrinkles in the mirrors waking up suddenly in the middle of the night and plunging into a ridiculous nightmare populated by a restless crowd that seeks in the senseless agitation its reason for agitation like me added the psychiatrist at the same time fleeing and searching in successive circles without purpose and without end a headless dog but with two tails that chase and repel each other moaning sadly with melancholic barks of a solitary person i had replaced my strict existence with the poor hollow whirligigs of a delirious clerk spinning fictitious cardboard joys; i had transformed life into a plastic scenario a schematic imitation of a reality too complex and demanding for my limited range of available feelings and so insignificant pierrot of a frustrated carnival i was quickly consumed by a portable little flame of anguish the doctor exchanged two conto de reis notes for five hundred escudos chips and sat down at his favorite french stand which was almost empty of players because the game was irregular he could feel the frenzy of the roulette tables on his back the slowness of which made him impatient with the croupiers counting endless piles of chips and a huddle of gamblers around them leaning towards the green cloth with the appetite of praying mantises the psychiatrist particularly noticed a very tall very thin englishwoman with a strapless dress hanging from the hanger at her collarbones still glistening with sun cream her skeletal hands dripping chips that she placed on the shoulders of the others in angular cranelike gestures the croupier announced small the dealer collected the losing chips and doubled the winning ones the doctor saw that the woman sitting to his left had written down three small ones in a row after two large ones so he pushed five hundred into the big area and waited first he told himself he would feel around following my mothers technique in the square at least having seen her haggle over fruit so much would be of some use to me and he smiled imagining what his mother a prudent and measured creature would think if she had found him there risking sums that she considered exorbitant going to bed late to arrive at the hospital even later the next day speeding down the steep slope of certain ruin tragic stories of fortunes evaporated at the casino were told in gloomy tones in the family evenings told in hollow tones by the tribes aedos aunt mane a historic octogenarian whose smile opened a zigzagging path through paintings and dried creams had lost the house silver in baccarat and used a pawn order instead of an identity card little one said the croupier putting down the dice cup and immediately engaging in a whispered conversation with the inspector their heads gently inclined like apostles at the last supper jesus and st john sharing the delights of the holy spirit the payer removed the doctors card with a deft maneuver of his tongue chameleon hunting an unwary fly the woman conscientiously noted the little one she was fat and blonde already worn out and wore a faux fur coat on her soft shoulders her profile resembled that of lavoisier in the oval portrait of the physics book from the 4th year of high school and threw two hundred and fifty escudos at a time with the furious determination of someone who obstinately loses on the opposite side of the table a scratchy old woman stubbornly threw twenty escudos at the aces in the hope of a miracle two guys with the air of prosperous construction foremen hesitated with matches in their teeth the chewing gum of the natives of tomar thought the psychiatrist betting again on the big cuttlefish with paint burnt yellow mercedes diesel and vila melita on the facade of the house the woman with the plastic leopard abstained a 12 came up a 13 a 14 a 12 an 18 the construction foremen each put five thousand escudos on the small a redhaired boy emerged from behind the doctors neck and threw five hundred on the big im already screwed thought the psychiatrist for no apparent reason other than a warning tightening in his esophagus he reached for his money and was about to fish it out when the croupier lifted his chin and said small with cruel indifference croupiers and analysts damn you i say goodbye to you and like a teenager i stumble with tenderness for you the doctor murmured to the card that the payer was bringing him arranging it next to the ones he had piled up in front of him if this mess keeps up like this ill soon be taking off my socks to put them on the aces winning a formula one jersey and committing suicide by swallowing an excessive dose of hundredpound slices the fat woman snuggled into the chair and her thigh touched the doctors who followed her bigs guess out of gratitude he had felt less alone since a fold of someone elses flesh was pressing against his knee the contractors moved to the small the redhaired boy resentful walked away grumbling there was always a redhead in camões classes the psychiatrist recalled a redhead a buffoon and a bespectacled one in the front rows; the bum was the worst at gymnastics the one with glasses was the best at geography and the redhead was the teachers favourite victim to take revenge for the anonymous pranks pissing in the wastepaper basket barking in the middle of reading the lusiads swearing in chalk on the blackboard; at the end of the second term their parents also redheads moved them to private schools perhaps reserved for redheads where pornographic photographs were freely lent athletic black men sodomising bitches priests in cassocks masturbating in the confessional homosexuals without rough edges giving themselves over to blurred orgies the fat woman smiled at him she was missing an incisor on top and had the pale gums of vasco da gama on the fortieth day of vitamin deficiency great proclaimed the croupier who was laughing respectfully at some joke made by the inspector its curious how the graces of superiors always have humor the doctor realized repeating the surprised phrase of one of his brothers who was astonished by the flattery as an incomprehensible phenomenon the payer leaned over to the croupier who repeated the anecdote of the boss who gravely approved with a solemn smile adjusting the angle of his collars is it or isnt it meireles meireles who was exchanging tokens with a hunchback raised his eyebrows without looking up from his work with the knowing grimace with which the psychiatrists aunts responded while counting the stitches of the knitting to their nephews questions have i grown have i really grown the psychiatrist wondered responding with his knee to the pressure of the woman with the plastic leopard on her hip assessing him sideways with a slow knowing eyelid have i really grown or have i remained a frightened kid squatting in the room among gigantic grownups who accuse me staring at me in silence with horrible hostility or coughing lightly covered with two fingers their resigned disapproval give me time he asked that circle of easter island idols who were chasing him with a fiercely disillusioned love give me time and i will be exactly what you want as you want me serious composed consistent adult helpful friendly stuffed slightly ambitious sinisterly cheerful darkly naive and definitely dead give me time give me time just give me time time to recall them before i shall speak out give me time team when i was a boy i kept a book to which from time to time i added pressed flowers until after a time i had a good collection but the sea which no one tends is also a garden when the sun strikes it and the waves are awakened i have seen it and so have y ou when it puts all flowers to shame time the doctor repeated i urgently need time to dress myself with courage to paste all my yesterdays into the photo album whod think to find y ou in a photograph perfectly quiet in the arrested chaff to arrange the features of my face to check the position of my nose in the mirror and to set out on the day that begins with the solid determination of a winner time to wait for you outside the ministry to go up the stairs with you to put the key in the door and to stumble embracing you without turning on the light to the bed dimly lit by the phosphorescent hands of the electric alarm clock disturbed by the excess of clothing and the sobs of tenderness relearning the braille of passion the fat woman placed her very long dark red nails on his arm her wrist identical to that of a driedup lizard was adorned with a filigree bracelet with an enormous medal of our lady of fatima clinking against an ivory fig and the psychiatrist felt as if he were about to be devoured by a tertiary reptile whose jaws the blood from the lipstick clearly revealed monstrous murderous intentions the dinosaurs eyes fixed him with the false intensity of the mascara under the eyebrows plucked to the thickness of a strip of thread and its chest rose and fell with a gilllike cadence giving its multiple necklaces the swaying of the kidneys of anchored boats the fingers crawled spiderlike up the doctors sleeve lightly pinching his thumb while his thigh completely absorbed his and a sharp heel pressed against his foot tearing off his heel in a malevolent caress the hunchback sitting on the left was noisily sucking on throat lozenges spreading the air with the aroma of asthmatic inhalations if i closed my eyelids tightly for a second i could easily imagine myself in marcel prousts room hidden behind the pile of handwritten notebooks of the recherche du temps perdu cest trop bête thats how he used to describe what he wrote je peux pas continuer cest trop bête dear uncle proust the wallpaper the fireplace the iron bed your difficult and courageous death but i was actually sitting at a gaming table at the casino and loneliness was eating away at me like a painful acid the idea of an empty house terrified me the idea of going back to sleep on the balcony made me groan with anticipated lumbago with my soul in a panic i threw the last chip to the grand if i win ill go straight to monte get under the covers and masturbate thinking about you until i fall asleep a recipe for relative success; if i lose ill invite this elderly boa constrictor to a modest orgy in keeping with her plastic coat and my threadbare jeans and in keeping with the end of a difficult month i honestly didnt know which of these two catastrophes to choose divided with equal horror between isolation and the snake a sumptuous spanish woman rubbed her magnificent buttocks against him an embroidered pillow for happier headsthe lean period would undoubtedly be his perpetual destiny and he would adapt to it in a bovine resignation a park bench somewhere patiently awaited his old age melancholically idle and it could well be that on wednesdays her younger brother would give her dinner at his house accompanying the roast meat with advice and reprimands mom always said youd never have any sense and probably not only would he never have any sense but even more seriously he would not achieve the kind of happiness that the absence of this strange attribute brings with it a ballast without which one flies to the pleasant heights of a fun madness without hassle without worries without plans at the mercy of adolescence assumed as a state of mind as a vocation or as destiny mother always said mother always said everything and it seemed to me that the inspector was gradually acquiring her prophetic look his eyelids bruised his forehead wrinkled the lit cigarette spiraling at the end of his arm in ellipses of surrender what can you expect from this boy nothing he said loudly in a kind of anger that startled the duck at the exact moment when the croupier put down the glass raised his chin looked around tightened the noose around his neck and informed small dictating a definitive sentence without his knowledge “are you really sure youre a doctor” the snake asked eyeing his shaved jeans his wornout sweater and the careless mess of his hair with suspicion they were both in the psychiatrists small car i dont know if i can fit in this thing next to the impressive tourist bus that was taking back its load of old american women in evening dresses with glasses suspended from their necks by silver threads like babies pacifiers accompanied by ruddyfaced men who looked like the hemingway in the final portraits i dont usually distrust people but you never know she added examining the professional id that the other man was handing her and im starting to get my share of scams if you believe you believe and then youll get the idea give me your id hey pretty girl and youll be stuck on the road watching the world go by excuse me its none of your business the sinner pays the price as the priests say and it never hurts to be careful i have a cousin on my fathers side whos a nurse in são jose in service one carregosa do you know him short strong bald a bit of a stutterer crazy about atletico he wears the emblem over his lab coat he played for the juniors his wife got stuck she only says “raisparta” “raisparta” forgive my caution sir but mendes always told me dori my name is dori be careful with strangers its better to be safe than sorry i even heard that from a lady who had her breasts removed at the cancer institute she used to get stretchers now she gets iv balloons shes almost as bad as mendes poor guy who after the revolution had to emigrate to brazil what can i do he left me a sweet letter assuring me that he would send me to be with him that he had never loved anyone as much as he loved me it was just a matter of months until he got his life together and that was it mulatto women dont even look at them they smell bad sooner or later ill take the boat to rio de janeiro hes a doctor of finance and economics and he wont dry up without getting a job ive never seen him as competent as mendes he works like a dog the wretch despite his weak lungs and then theres more to it than that its his delicacy his manners his way of treating a woman guess what you want he never hit me almost every week he brought me flowers jewelry dinners at comodoro movies of course i told him "my son theres no need for so much luxury" but mendes knew i was getting a kick out of it he didnt care he was a saint on the altar i can see him with his sideburns very well groomed i gave him a filichaive for christmas his pink and black shirt impeccable his nail polish shining pause why dont you put on a natural silk tie a pieddepule jacket and some hairspray ive never seen a doctor so poorly dressed so mechanical doctors must have representation right who wants to deal with a slovenly slovenly psychiatrist when i go to the cashier i demand respect and seriousness you can tell by the look on peoples faces whether theyre competent or not no you dont think so the specialists as they should be wear vests have silver beaded beadlets houses with chandeliers golden taps that are like fish squirting water you go in there and you notice the money that quinane is walking around at the time of death tell me what do you do today and in life without money without money i feel like im dying its my gasoline you get it take my crocodile wallet away from me and ill be completely lost im used to luxuries what do you want maybe you wont believe it but my father was a veterinary professor in lamego she took a contraband camel out of a hideous cardboard purse that looked like an alligator and lit it with a bakelite lighter that looked like a turtle the psychiatrist noticed that her shoes with their incredibly high heels needed halfsoles and that large unpolished creases were streaking the leather on the instep sales at the plaza de chile he diagnosed the roots of her blond locks were growing grey where the parting was and powder tried unsuccessfully to mask the multiple deep wrinkles around her eyes and along her soft cheeks which hung from her chin in sagging curtains of flesh she must have carried photographs of her grandchildren andreia milena paulo alexandre sonia filipa in her purse “next week ill be thirtyfive” she informed him cheekily “if you promise to put on a tuxedo and take me out to dinner at a decent restaurant as far away from caracois da esperanca as possible ill invite you ever since mendes left ive had an empty heart” and feeling my shoulder im a very affectionate person my dear i cant live without love you probably dont earn much huh doctors are skinning you if you got ready did your hair bought a little suit on avenida de roma maybe youd look good although for me money

passionate about you at first glance theres nothing to be done i like you let me put on my glasses to observe you better to love you even more first he took out a pencil case pushed it back into the back of his desk poca these are the ones from far away and extracted from a jumble of tissues tram tickets and crumpled documents a pair of lenses as thick as a kaleidoscope behind which the pupils disappeared dissolved in the thickness of the glass the psychiatrist felt as if he were being examined by a poorquality microscope oh son but youre so young the diopters exclaimed in surprise youre about my age thirtythree thirtyfour at most right id bet two hundred and fifty bucks that youre thirtyfour im never wrong about years if it were like that with the lottery i would have opened a boutique in areeiro more than a hundred years ago mendes swore to me on his brothers bones that are underground that he would put me in penha de franca and then the communists would come and rob us

rest of my life the priest latinating at the altar and i saying on my knees little do you know what you pray for my scoundrel long live benfica who is no longer here who screwed me the doctor reached the riverbank and returned to monte estoril there was a nightclub at the foot of the hill where he would not run much risk of bumping into people who knew him he was ashamed to be seen in the company of that overly noisy woman at least twice his age fighting against decrepitude and poverty through an absurd performance that was at once ridiculous and touching which made him feel ashamed of his shame deep down they were no different from each other and in a certain sense their frantic struggles were similar they were both fleeing the same unbearable solitude and both for lack of means and courage abandoned themselves without a fight to the anguish of dawn like terrified owls the doctor remembered a phrase by scott fitzgerald a distressed crew member of the boat they were on left ashore on a previous voyage his heart exhausted and fueled by the bitter oxygen of alcohol in the darkest night of the soul it is always three oclock in the morning he reached out his hand and stroked the dinosaurs neck with sincere tenderness hello my old lady lets cross this darkness together his thumb declared moving up and down along her neck lets cross this darkness together the only way out is through the bottom as pavia informed us before embracing his train the only way out is through the bottom and perhaps by supporting each other we will get there brueghels blind men groping you and i through this corridor full of childhood fears and the wolves that inhabit insomnia with threats ah ah exclaimed dory with a smile of triumph cheeky huh and he squeezed my testicles with his nutcracker fingers until i screamed in pain the boîte must have been at the end of its journey that night the only inhabitants apart from the oneeyed waiter who served us a gin and a plastic plate of popcorn with obvious bad manners and the girl with the records who was reading uncle scrooge in her sound cage a music box figure bent over like a foetus there were two sleepy men leaning against the counter their equine noses buried in baskets of grapefruit and who stared at the tertiary woman who was swaying her gigantic hips in front of me with the distracted attention given to an uninteresting ruin the ceiling lights pulsing softly to the rhythm of a tango illuminated the pindaric stage of my execution iron chairs from a cafe terrace a switchedoff television on a high shelf the shells and circular footprints of glasses on the tabletops he died in poverty explained the reading books about deceased poets skeletal bearded men suspended in thoughtful attitudes probably meditating on what to do next or making precious alexandrines in their heads dori who was returning at dawn to a young maid gilded by the solid marriage promises of a soldier cousin asked for a sausage sandwich with lard from which she offered the doctor in a sudden turn of delicacy the first bite she chewed with her mouth open like the cement trucks and they danced sweetly exchanging pieces of crust quick porridge youre so sweet like shipwrecked people fraternally sharing the rations of the raft the oneeyed man elbowed the horses of the bagasse and the three of them remained watching them in motionless stupefaction astonished by the amazing scene of an aging adolescent in the arms of a paleolithic whale with a large frilled mane fuck the terrified doctor thought inhaling the wargaslike scent of 14 that was released in lethal coils from the back of the womans neck what would i do if i were in my place its five in the morning and i swear i dont miss you dori is inside sleeping on her back her arms outstretched crucified on the sheets and her false teeth detached from the roof of her mouth move forward and backward to the rhythm of her breathing in a damp suctionlike noise we both drink the brandy from the kitchen from the leaf jug sitting naked on the bed that the war gas has made uninhabitable by charring even the printed sheets of the pillowcases i listen to her longwinded confidences i wipe away her confused crying that tattooed my elbow with a mascara bush i pull the blanket up to her neck like a pious shroud over a broken body and i come out onto the balcony to pick up the hardened droppings of the birds its cold the houses and trees are slowly emerging from the darkness the sea is a towel that is becoming clearer and clearer but i dont think about you i swear i dont think about you i feel good happy free content i hear the last train down there i can guess the seagulls waking up i breathe the peace of the city in the distance i break out into a happy smile and i feel like singing if i had a telephone and you called me now you would carefully place the receiver against your ear in a shelllike expectation through the bakelite coils coming from miles away from this concrete balcony suspended over the end of the night you would have together with the echo of my silence the victorious echo of my silence the muffled piano of the waves tomorrow i will start life all over again i will be the serious and responsible adult that my mother wishes and my family awaits i will arrive on time at the infirmary punctual and serious i will comb my hair to reassure the patients i will trim my vocabulary of pointed obscenities maybe my love ill buy a tiger tapestry like mr ferreiras you might think its stupid but i need something to help me exist
